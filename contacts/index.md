Quattor is developed and supported entirely by the community that uses it, there are no full-time paid developers.

We encourage everyone to get involved in the Quattor community and we're eager to help you out!

We can be found on the following mailing lists:

* [quattor-discuss] &mdash; Where we discuss general questions and help each other fix problems.
* [quattor-devel] &mdash; Covering issues relating to core code, libraries and the development process.

All our code and documentation (including this website) is hosted on GitHub, if you find bugs or things that could be improved, please open an issue and/or pull request on GitHub.
If you're not sure which repository to open the issue again (there are a lot) please ask!

Standup Meetings
===
---
Quattor development principles are inspired by the  Agile Manifesto. Development process is based on the scrum method, an agile software development methodology.

A key idea of the scrum method is to make small incremental steps toward implementing new features and improvements required by the users. For Quattor, all the missing features, desirable functionalities or wishes are registered as GitHub issues.

Development progress is reviewed at a weekly standup meeting held by Vidyo every Thursday at 1:15 pm CET. Connection information is:

* Computer, smartphones: You can use [vidyoportal]. The room name is `Standup_Meeting`.
    * You need to login as guest (name is free, use something informational!).
    * Note that by default your Vidyo client starts with both audio and video muted
* Phone bridges: dial phone number of the selected bridge, enter 109296756 as the extension (both numbers are generally followed by #)
    * See phone bridge [list and instructions]. Please note: if your local number does not work, try using the CERN number.
