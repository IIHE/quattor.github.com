# 6th Quattor Workshop - NIKHEF - 27-29/10/08

[Agenda](http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceTimeTable.py?confId=40056).

## Introduction - S. Child

Quattor survey: 48 answer, 27 sites using Quattor, 14 countries

-   Still a strong use of CDB: as used as SCDB

[Slides](http://indico.cern.ch/materialDisplay.py?contribId=10&sessionId=4&materialId=slides&confId=40056).

Evaluation of Quattor community:

-   Strengths:
-   Open and supportive community
-   Improving integration with related tools (monitoring, VMs)
-   Large suite of configuration components (254)
-   Well defined language model
-   Good support for gLite
-   Weaknesses:
    -   Lack of effort for release management
    -   No automated build and test
    -   Lack of documentation, in specially quick-start style
    -   Difficult to contribute (access to repositories)
    -   Legacy architecture makes writing components difficult
    -   No official support for gLite configuration with Quattor
    -   Hard to bootstrap because of the many external dependencies
    -   Level of knowledge still low among prospective "customers"

Need to focus effort on completing migration from grid, CERN-centered
usage model to a generic open source project.

-   More information on documentation and packaging
-   Quattor appliance for site bootstrap
-   Dissemenation: several things done recently (EGEE, LISA, HEPiX).
    More to do: SC, Linux sysadmins...
-   Seek funding for dedicated development efforts ? High overhead but
    may be worth

Goals for the workshop:

-   Finalize structures for opening up community collaboration:
    accelerate move to SourceForge, ensure access rights are easy to
    manage
-   Coordinate tool development: centralise and catalogue existing tools
-   Decide on sustainable build and release procedures, as automated as
    possible, not dependent from one person

## Site Reports

### GRIF - M. Jouvin

[Slides](http://indico.cern.ch/materialDisplay.py?contribId=2&sessionId=4&materialId=paper&confId=40056).

### UAM - L. Munoz

Using QWG + SCDB.

Manpower potential problem: Luis applied for a fellowship at CERN.

Documentation: would like a tool for automatic extraction of
documentation from PAN code

-   Doxygen plugin for PAN

Packages lists are much too long and sometimes cannot be handled at
installation time.

-   Currently 1200 packages on a 64-bit machine, was able to reduce it
    to 411 on a WN

SCDB at UAM configured to use <svn:externals>: great for update but a
problem if LAL is down. Will be worst if moving to SourceForge.

We'like to impement new ant targets without modifying build.xml.

Had like to implement a staging strategy for deploying changes: fits
better on a distributed model.

-   How specific is AQDB from Morgan and Stanley
-   Is CDB over Git or Mercurial a project worth the effort ?

### CERN - V. Lef√©bure {#cern---v.-lefebure}

[Slides](http://indico.cern.ch/materialDisplay.py?contribId=5&sessionId=4&materialId=slides&confId=40056).

Main instances: 6300 profiles, 140 clusters

-   Less than in March 08 because of retired HW
-   panc: still using panc v6
-   Cake now multithreaded
-   Starting to use namespaces in SL5 templates
-   SPMA and SWrep: starting to have VO-dedicated SWrep, still not
    enforcing RPM signing
-   CDB2SQL: rewrite almost complete
-   CCM: use SSL-based transfer, with fallback to http:
-   More and more CDB users: ACL working well but management is an issue
-   Update to Quattor 1.3 templates well under way

Xen-based virtualisation being taken over by Ewan Roche

### CNAF - A. Chierici

Quattor 1.3 templates (namespace): still a lot to be adapted to new
schema:

-   Conversion going on smoothly, with help from ME. Storage people
    very happy.
-   Imported templates for configuring ncm-yaim from NIKHEF
-   CEs on a 64-bit OS using Michel's tricks: improved the situation
    a lot.
-   WN 64-bit tested and soon in production

Xen used on LHCb-T2 and a few nodes in T1

-   Dom0 managed by hand

Building RPM lists: tried checkdeps.py but failed because of the YUM
version required.

-   Currently using a node in a VM to install metapackage and
    dependencies and produce the RPM list

CDB vs. SCDB: thinking about migrating, to take advantage of advanced
logging features. Also concern on CDB support after ME leaves.

-   No plan to use QWG at the beginning
-   CNAF is very short on staff members and temporary contracts will be
    reduced

### Philips - S.

2 instances based on SCDB + QWG:

-   testgrid: 6 nodes, based on VMs
-   biggrid: 206 nodes, including a SE with 3 disk servers

Future:

-   panc v8
-   Dummy template for WNs
-   Nagios integration
-   Xen to run biggrid services

### Grid Ireland - S. Childs

\[<http://indico.cern.ch/materialDisplay.py?contribId=3&sessionId=4&materialId=slides&confId=40056>\].

1 SCDB for 22 sites

-   17 externals, 5 internals
-   7 site admins, 5.4 average commits per day
-   450 managed machines
-   20 Quattor servers

Monitoring expanded: Nagios deployed through Quattor

-   Local sensors + read in EGEE SAMs
-   LEMON erros fed to Nagios

panc v8 now in use: logging features already invaluable

Configured iSCSI+RAID storage (aggregating WN disks).

Issues and future work:

-   Would like equivalent to WN speedup integrated into the compiler as
    dummy workaround is too fragile
-   Dependency checker now incompatible with our SL4 server
-   Get network, filesystems, IPMI under Quattor control
-   Configuring cross-site redundancy for core services using drbd+Xen
-   Get all TCD admins actively contributing to Quattor community

=== NIKHEF - R. Starink ===

[Slides](http://indico.cern.ch/materialDisplay.py?contribId=0&sessionId=4&materialId=slides&confId=40056).

Now using SCDB with some local modifications, with SCDB inside
Subversion

-   Still using panc 7.2.9, upgrade planned Dec./Jan.

AII: added new feature to give Anaconda literal definition of
filesystems

-   blockdevices and filesystems seen as too risky for SEs

Cloning WN definitions for speeding up but issue with dependencies when
recompiling

Redundant repository servers with DNS load balancing

Projects:

-   Virtualization: not yet based on QWG but considering to move. Want
    to work on management: where is my VM running, what should host X do
    ? See QuatView talk.
-   Monitoring via Nagios: client side already done by Quattor, servers
    still manually configured but considering QWG.
-   NCG: will try YAIM
-   Planning OS setup via QWG

Issues:

-   SW updates:
-   Kernel: install only a limited number of updates
-   gLite: update repository for WN separate from other node types
-   SPMA pb with RPM file/pkg name mismatch
-   PAN schema: would like a property describing node function
    (CE, WN...)
-   ncm-xen: support for relocatable domUs
-   ncm-yaim: remove siteinfo.def on failure

### LAPP - E. Fede

SCDB + QWG templates used for 2 years for grid resource and started
recently used it for internal systems.

-   Quattor runs in a VM for easier backup and restore. But this is at
    the price of performances : 3mn for 100 templates.
-   4 people involved in Quattor management
-   Management of GPFS nodes with Quattor: selection of appropriate RPMs
    based on kernel version, configuration of SSH keys...

Wish: web interface for AII

### GRNET/AUTH - C. Triantafyllidis

Since Nov. 2007, using SCDB + QWG templates

-   Started during EDG with LCFG and LCFGng
-   First look at Quattor in 2006 and first attempt to use it mid-2007
    with CDB + YAIM
-   Remaining issue: installing a new node type is still not trivial but
    site is now consistent
-   Troubleshooting errors often involved a node without Quattor and
    comparing

Synchronization with LCG QWG repository still a painful process

-   Introduced a cfg/local to hold all local modifications common to
    both sites managed from SCDB and also to redefine machine-types
-   Missed that standard machine-types could be customized without
    duplicating/redefining
-   gLite updates is still not a straightforward process: need testing
    nodes

Components: several new components written (Pakiti, hydraclient, hydra).

-   Ganglia component in progress
-   A few components patches (krb5client)

Working on a web interface for management providing a web-based wizard
for creating profiles from templates, creating new hardware templates
and updating RPMs.

Current status in Greece: half of sites using Quattor for initial
installation, only 2 sites for the full management

-   Doing some efforts to get other site using it for the full site
    management too

### Morgan & Stanley - N. Williams

Currently moving 6500 nodes under the new ''Aquilon'' system based on
Quattor

-   Alread a few hundreds
-   1 Quattor server, 6 boot servers (DHCP+TFTP), 14 admins among which
    6 template amdins
-   Monitoring with LEMON + perfdata: LEMON used for aggregated views

Aquilon vs. QWG templates: Aquilon is based on a relational model where
a node is associated with a role

-   Plenary templates: templates that provide date to the
    other templates. Typically generated on the fly from an
    external source.
-   Template library: what configuration is required to provide specific
    behaviours, implementing configuration policies given the input
    plenary data.
-   Only template library is versionned.
-   Modeled after QWG ideas but with a different layout: every group of
    templates grouped by ''archetype'' (one archetype is ''qwg'', others
    are ''aquilon'', ''service'', ''hardware'', ''pan'', implemented as
    a pan namespace).
-   Own standard schema to add M&S-specific information: location
    details, events/actions, archetype, personality, release and version
    allowed for components...
-   Distributed services modeled with several instances for
    redundancy, scalability. Instances of each service are described
    into ''service'' archetype. One specific node uses one
    specific instance. Personality describes the services required but
    not the instance (selected using plenary template information).

Aquilon vs. CDB: decided not to use CDB but instead roll our own

-   Replacing an aging asset database, integrating with legacy dbs.
-   Based on Oracle
-   Use AQD broker (written in Python) that mediates Aquilon commands to
    Oracle
-   Entitlement done in AQD broker

Sandboxes used to implement staged deployment

-   Hosts are associated with 1 sandbox and can be moved from one to
    another without any config change
-   A sandbox implemented as a SCM branch: SCM used is Git
-   Production templates cannot be edited but can only takes merges from
    sandboxes
-   Still to come: unit testing of sandboxes, better cherry-picking
    tools and methodology (based on Git hooks)

Bootservers:

-   DHCP, SPMA proxies, Kickstart servers
-   CDB notification from AQD trigger aii-shellfe --notify: 2s per
    client to configure
-   AQ translates pxeswitch commandes into ai-installfe requests to the
    appropriate servers
-   Just switched to AII v2 to get advantage of more flexible file
    system and block device definitions. But problems with performances
    due to the plugin-based architecture. A few patches made, in
    particular to support selectable CCM database formats (will
    use CDB\_file).

Statistics:

-   Infrastructure servers are 8 core, 2.5Ghz, 16GB
-   PAN: 13 profiles per second compile, &lt;3 mn for 2K hosts, XML
    profiles are approx 230 KB
-   Reconfiguring bootservers: 1 client takes 2s, reconfinguring 2K
    tagkes more than 1h...
-   Installation: 700 RPMs, 1.8 GB, 15 minutes
-   10% transient failures on installing because of ccm-fetch unable to
    get its lock

Wishes and remarks:

-   Boot servers don't need whole profile
-   ROCKS RPM download vi abittorient
-   Components often have insufficient logging, not easy to get status
    of component configuration
-   Really want to participate with development: SourceForge wil be a
    Really Good Thing
-   Subclassing components allows for replicated functionality but
    better transactions
-   Entitlements in PAN
-   LEMON and SLS are 'under-sold"

## Core Components

### CDB - M.E. Poleggi

[Slides](http://indico.cern.ch/materialDisplay.py?contribId=12&sessionId=3&materialId=slides&confId=40056).

Mainly busy with CNAF operations, not a lot of development

-   Mainly cdb-tpl-view and pangraph ready for panc v8): not CDB
    specific
-   No progress on fine grain locking and common authentication
    framework

cdb/cdb-soap

-   Faster state management
-   Multi-threaded dependency calculation
-   Authentication supports locking

Wish list:

-   ACLs restrictions on include
-   Expose some CVS features to end-user

panc v8: still some problems, investigating...

Scalability of dependency calculation: requires a lot of operations and
CPU, improved by moving to multi-threaded dependency calculation.

### SCDB - M. Jouvin

[Slides](http://indico.cern.ch/getFile.py/access?contribId=13&sessionId=3&resId=0&materialId=slides&confId=40056).

### QWG - M. Jouvin

[Slides](http://indico.cern.ch/getFile.py/access?contribId=13&sessionId=3&resId=2&materialId=slides&confId=40056).

### PAN Compiler - C. Loomis

\[<http://indico.cern.ch/materialDisplay.py?contribId=14&sessionId=3&materialId=slides&confId=40056>\].

Current version: 8.2.2

-   v8 is a major rewrite
-   8.2.3 should be released next week
-   Significant language and implementation changes from v7
-   Known intermittent threading problem since v7: not yet identified
-   7.2.9 is in maintenance: no new feature

Future plans:

-   Facilitate pan language edtior and debugger
-   Making grammar changes for better support: save comments...
-   Internal refactoring to make such things easier: ability to
    put breakpoints...
-   Performance: continued optimization for generated code, reduce
    memory footpring via object sharing, understand speed differences
    between machines, JVMs...
-   SL4/SL5 difference: 2x slower
-   XInclude support: replace stream, fetc, embed...

Language changes planned for v9 (not before next meeting..):

-   Remove deprecated syntax from v8
-   Authentitcation/authorization: still requires some discussion to
    find the appropriate solution (based on type extension) without
    performance degradation
-   Support for annotation (doxygen)

### AII - L. Munoz

\[<http://indico.cern.ch/materialDisplay.py?contribId=15&sessionId=3&materialId=slides&confId=40056>\].

Lots of feedback and bug fixes in the last months.

New hooks:

-   Aconda hook
-   NBP hook

AII runs in tainted mode: ill-formed profiles won't force AII to do
wrong things

-   Still sensible to symlink attacks

Known issues:

-   File system creation is slow: working on improvements for 1.4
-   aii-dhcp still around and doesn't fit v2's philosphy based on
    plugins: slow down aii-shellfe because it is doing DNS requests
-   Implement a ncm-dhcp component that can be used as a replacement ?
-   Reduce the number of profile download: currently one per AII command
-   Remove 'base\_url not defined' message

Dropping root privilege for AII

-   aii-shellfe running as user aii
-   /osintall owned by aii
-   sudo for running aii-dhcp or ncm-dhcp component
-   Install CGI no longer running as root

Document SINDES hooks or similar solutions to install certificates
during installation

-   Link to BEGRID wiki

### Other Modules - M.E. Poleggi

[Slides](http://indico.cern.ch/materialDisplay.py?contribId=17&sessionId=3&materialId=slides&confId=40056)

CAF:

-   Ability to log to syslog
-   Process.pm: wrapper over LC::Process with support for verbose run
-   FileWriter.pm: wrapper for file writing operations
-   Fixed Reporter.pm

LC: updated to last version, should try to pick up changes more
frequently

-   In fact it is currently maintained even though we don't have much
    contact with Lionel

CCM: not unescape(), getUnescapedName(), fixed for taint mode

-   Still on todo list: de-privileged CCM execution, flag for disabling
    CCM updates

cdispd:

-   Redirected output to aovid SElinux related problems: but a pb in the
    implementation, needs to be fixed (V√©ronique)
-   Wish list: disable further updates by Quattor (inhibition flag using
    a property in profile)

ncd:

-   NCM::Check extended with 'noaction' for overriding the global flag
-   NCD/\* inheriting from CAF::RepoerterMany
-   Sanitization to run in taint mode without warnings
-   Wish list: protect against malicious modifications of profile, for
    example signing it

ncm-templates: no change

-   Todo list: review it and remove everything that was AII v1 specific

SPMA/rpmt: ME reports situation where RPM encouters warning during
scripts and SPMA returns a success even though, running the same command
manuallu returns rc&lt;&gt;0

-   To be investigated, not so clear...

pangraph + cdb-tpl-view ready for namespaces and navigation via panc
logging information

New tools: checkdeps, QuatView...

## New Tools

### checkdeps.py - S. Childs

[Slides](http://indico.cern.ch/materialDisplay.py?contribId=18&sessionId=3&materialId=slides&confId=40056).

Goal: check dependency problems before deployement rather than after

-   Only approach to make it efficient and robust is to use package
    metadata, normally not available on the machine you compile on
-   When you start to write something, you realize you are
    rewritting YUM...

checkdeps concept:

-   Retrieve package list from node profile parsing XML file
-   Create YUM repository for each repository in profile
-   Instruct YUM to use only these repositories and to use checkdeps
    configuration
-   Create a transaction set for YUM will all packages in

Issues:

-   YUM doesn't have a real API: have to run in debug mode and parse YUM
    output

When it works it's great but hard to get working!

-   YUM parsing very version sensitive
-   Current version requires up-to-date createrepo on server (SL5+)
-   Even when up-to-date, can return misleading results...

Conclusion:

-   This is definitely the way to go... almost there. Can get the result
    in a few seconds for a profile.
-   Parsing YUM output really doesn't work reliably: should consider
    adding "dtermineDesp" to YUM that returns the list of additional
    packages requires as a Python stucture

### QuatView - T. Suerink (NIKHEF)

[Slides](http://indico.cern.ch/materialDisplay.py?contribId=19&sessionId=3&materialId=slides&confId=40056).

Web-based display of information from profiles to display OS, MAC
address... of every node.

-   SCDB compatible
-   Flexible, one config file
-   Profiles parsed into a SQL db: database updated with as script that
    can run as a cron
-   QuatView backend may be merged with CDB2SQL
-   For simple reports could produce an XML file rather than a database

### Panc Logging Tools

Main logging categories:

-   Includes
-   Calls : includes + function calls
-   Tasks: performance of each internal tasks
-   Memory
-   Threads
-   All/None

panc delivered with a set of perl scripts getting the logging output and
produces reasonable human-readable summaries.

### New Tools : Requests and Status - S. Childs

[Slides](http://indico.cern.ch/materialDisplay.py?contribId=21&sessionId=3&materialId=slides&confId=40056).

Several categories identified:

-   Debugging
-   panc logging: part of PAN
-   pangraph: able to graph output pan logging tools
-   pantree: deprecated
-   checkdeps: in QWG
-   gencompswebdoc: generate html documentation for components, in CERN
    CVS
-   cdb-pl-view: simple template viewer in PHP, not CDB-specific, must
    be renamed, CERN CVS
-   cdb-getclusters: CERN specific
-   lld2pkgs, rpmcheck.pl: obsolete, replaced by checkdeps, QWG
-   xmldb2hw: very limited, superceded by QuatView, QWG
-   xml2pkgs: generate RPM list from set of XML profiles, obsolete, QWG
-   compare\_xml: compare 2 XML profiles, QWG
-   Setup
-   rpmConflicts: very old stuff, obsolete, CERN CVS
-   fill\_swrep\_server: import RPM to SWrep through SOAP interface,
    move to SWrep, CERN CVS
-   getpkgarch: very old, probably obsolete, CERN CVS
-   quattor-etics-add-component: generate and upload component config to
    ETICS, CERN CVS
-   mac: tool for capturing MAC addresses, obsolete, CERN CVS
-   quattor-client-install: installs Quattor SW on non-Quattor machine,
    QWG
-   AII web interface: from TCD, not committed yet, more work needed
-   Template generation
-   buildOSTemplates and companion tools: generate OS RPM templates, QWG
-   createPackagesTemplate: generate a templae list from a repository or
    URL, QWG
-   html2pan: script used before ant update.rep.templates existed,
    obsolete, QWG
-   generate-hw-templates: generate HW template from a CSV, quite
    LAL-specific currently, QWG
-   rpmq2panpkg: generate a PAN pkg list from installed RPM on the
    current machine, CERN CVS
-   groupandpasswd2tpl: same for user and groups, QWG
-   rpmErrata, rpmUpdates: should move into createPackagesTemplates, QWG
-   ncmtplconv: convert flat components to namespace, CERN CVS
-   check-compile.sh: download and compile SCDB + QWG trees, should be
    renameed, QWG
-   quattor build tools: CERN CVS

Tool requests from survey:

-   GUI for CDB
-   Pan parser for Doxygen
-   The base "getting started tools"
-   CDB (cdbop) grep functionality, dependency information:
    CDB-specific, SCDB has existing tools
-   Display inclusion tree for templates: panc v8 logging
-   Having the possibility to restore a machine configuration to a given
    date: just revert configuration DB
-   XSL stylesheets fir visualization of node profiles so that they can
    be viewed in a browser

GUI: Eclipse for SCDB

-   Benefit from work on Eclipse
-   Effort of developing own GUI would be huge and better spent
    elsewhere
-   Also the need for some web-based wizards

Need to merge in 1 location from the 3 repositories and merge duplicate
functionalities

Need to document recipes on wik FAQ page

-   A lot of documentation available, but need to rationalize
-   SF area for documentation HTML

## Monitoring in QWG - S. Childs

\[<http://indico.cern.ch/materialDisplay.py?contribId=31&sessionId=3&materialId=slides&confId=40056>\].

Objectives:

-   Describe monitoring one for each machine class
-   Configure the server too using nlist to describe each machine to
    monitor
-   Support hierarchy: cluster aggregates similar nodes, super-cluster
    aggregates clusters

NCG: template added to QWG for Nagios NCG services

-   Currently adds services for SAM and NPM tests and provides some
    variables for local customizations

         include {'standard/monitoring/nagios/ncg_services'};

TCD Usage: Lemon + Nagios host monitoring

-   Nagios: active network checks
-   LEMON: host checking via LEMON metrics
-   LEMON results fed to Nagios, output sent to Nagios via nsca

It'd be nice to get the last version of LEMON sensors and metrics from
CERN

-   They are still in old format but this is a pretty easy task to
    convert them

## OpenVZ - L. Munoz

[Slides](http://indico.cern.ch/materialDisplay.py?contribId=30&sessionId=3&materialId=slides&confId=40056).

OpenVZ is a virtualization solution with the following specific
features:

-   Run as a partition (container) in kernel host
-   No specific kernel, HW... for the guest

Limitations:

-   VMs can only run Linux
-   VMs cannot use kernel thread (eg. run a NFS server)

Quattor implications:

-   Use of a single file system for all VEs
-   No Anoconda
-   Host requires an OpenVZ kernel (namespacing patches) and OpenVZ
    tools (vzctl...)
-   Host acts as a router for VMs
-   Guest declaration: container ID, network information, limit on
    resources
-   Configured with ncm-openvz
-   Avoid to install all VMs at same time (SPMA...)

Guest installation: no Anaconda, only post-reboot script with aii-openvz

-   file sysystem, HW description... must be empty
-   Virtual Ethernet (veth): slower, less secure than OpenVZ default
    network but able to receive broadcasts
-   Not handled by ncm-openvz, must be bridged and configured with
    ncm-network

To be committed soon...

## Coding Practices and Conventions - L. Munoz

[Slides](http://indico.cern.ch/materialDisplay.py?contribId=16&sessionId=3&materialId=slides&confId=40056).

Identation: preferred is 4 whitespaces, no tab

-   If identation style is changed, do it in a revision dedicated to
    formatting changes, not embedded into other changes

Coding style: be consistent with the existing coding style if any, else
cleanup the code to adhere to one coding style

-   If identation style is changed, do it in a revision dedicated to
    formatting changes, not embedded into other changes

Modularity: avoid very long function or instruction blocks

Comments:

-   Comment PAN data structures in PAN code
-   Comment function in function headers
-   Don't embed a lot of comment into the code

Other recommandations:

-   Misc: use 'our' instead of 'use vars'
-   Don't use system or qx// or LC::Process but CAF::Process as it logs
    the command being executed and stores the exit status in \$?
-   Writing files: use CAF::FileWriter
-   Can also be used for temporary files
-   For feeding a command, use a pipe with CAF::Process
-   Use LC::File or <File::Copy> or <File::PAth> as it does many checks,
    in particular it doesn't follow symlinks
-   Make sure code is running in taint mode: don't trust any input,
    sanitize command/system call input

Missing bit in CAF:

-   CAF::FileReader ?
-   Any need to rewrite/improve NCM::Check::lines ?
-   A module to download and verify from the Internet ?

A wiki page on Twiki exists decribing these conventions, linked from
SourceForge

## SourceForge Migration

### Resources Available - S. Childs

[Slides](http://indico.cern.ch/materialDisplay.py?contribId=23&sessionId=3&materialId=slides&confId=40056).

File release; what is under download menu, no APT/YUM, size unlimited

-   Easy to rsync what's there
-   Currently only panc and ncm-components

Wiki: up and running, need people to contribute

-   Web space: up and running, redirected to the wiki, also used for
    docs, 100 MB

Mailing lists, issue trackers: not investigated yet

-   Any need to migrate from CERN savannah ?

Forums: not investigated yet, are they useful for us?

Documentation: not investigated yet

-   Try to redirect to wiki

### Migration Status - S. Childs

First prototype based on an import from CVS of the agreed components
from CVS with cvs2svn

-   First version of SVN-ready quattor build tools
-   trunk, tags, branches at the top level

Quattor build tools: 1 copy per "core component" (through
<svn:externals>)

-   ncm-components must be treated specifically to avoid one copy per
    component: they are considered as 1 Quattor component
-   Proposal:
-   1 copy of build tools for all components
    -   requires build tools to be updated for components within tags
        (to dynamically work out how far back up the tree the build
        tools are)
-   Tagging per component, with a 'stable' release
-   tags/ncm-components/stable containing an <svn:externals> to each
    individual component release

Tags:

-   Same hierarchy as under trunk
-   tags/ncm-components must contain an external reference to quattor
    build tools
-   Global release tags must be defined under tags/ with a reference
    (either a branch copy or <svn:externals>) to all individual
    component versions part of the release

Final structure agreed:

    quattor-build-tools
    trunk/ccm/qbt
    trunk/ncm-components/qbt
    trunk/ncm-components/ncm-*

    tags/ccm/stable/qbt
            /a.a.a/qbt
        /ncm-components/qbt
        /ncm-components/ncm-accounts/a.a.b/

Action plan: '''open new repository Dec. 1st'''

1.  Implement new agreed structure, modify build tools to handle it
2.  Test new structure
3.  Set CVS readonly
4.  Reexport CVS

Issue tracker, mailing lists... discussed at next workshop

-   panc will use the bug tracker as soon as it is mooved

Need also to work on backup of what is in SF as there is no backup
provided.

-   1 unique backup solution for SVN , wiki... ?
-   SVN mirrored with svnk ?

### QWG Migration

In principle agreement to move sources to SF

-   SCDB can be moved as soon as SF is "stable" and backuped
-   QWG templates: more difficult because of the cross-reference from
    TracWiki relying on SVN Python API that doesn't support non local
    references (Trac and SVN server must run on same machine)

Need to gain more experience with SF wiki to decide if it is worth
migrating the documentation.

## Quattor Releases

### Release Status - ME Poleggi

[Slides](http://indico.cern.ch/materialDisplay.py?contribId=25&sessionId=2&materialId=slides&confId=40056).

1.4-1 underway

-   Still to fix CDB issue with panc v8
-   SL3 not supported anymore

1.4-2 or 1.5 will support SL5

Release are still important for starters... would like to continue
providing a semestrial release.

-   But ME contract is ending in a few months...
-   Is it really worth the effort ? Probably a Quattor appliance would
    be more useful... Lets do 1.4-1 and revisit global releases later.

### Build Process and Tools - S. Childs

[Slides](http://indico.cern.ch/materialDisplay.py?contribId=26&sessionId=2&materialId=slides&confId=40056).

We need automatic builds to provide a public SW repository, in
particular for ncm-components

-   May also ease release process
-   SourceForge doesn't provide any build facilities

Experience with ETICS during the last year: it works but client is
awkard and unstable

-   Is it work to stick with it ?
-   What other alternative (Cruise?) ? Who can host it ?
-   LAL could rebuild all components in its RPM repository and provide
    them with a YUM repository
-   LAPP is also proposing to do it, as its contribution to Quattor

Building documentation: documentation and status page must be derived
from the code. '''Solutions requiring editing a wiki will not work.'''

-   For ncm-components, gencompswebdoc was developped to extract
    documentation for components
-   Need to be run regularly

## Open Bug Review

We should do it before the meeting...

## Action Summary

### Stephen Childs

-   Check in AII web interface
-   Integrate Grid-Ireland site/cluster hierarchy for SCDB
-   Make sure TCD monitoring additions are checked in to QWG and
    documented (in particular conversion of lists of machine classes to
    nagios hostgroups)
-   Check in code for QuatView
-   Revisit checkdeps to try and get it working with SL4
-   Investigate potential enhancements to YUM
-   Put tools inventory on wiki

### Morgan Stanley

-   Check in patches for AII (via Luis)
-   Check in patches to components (once SF migration complete)
-   Report on ease of use of cdb2sql (and compatibility with different
    sql implementations)

### MEP

-   Finish quattor release 1.4
-   Update quattor build tools

### Luis

-   Extend coding conventions page with all code snippets (and move to
    SF wiki?)
-   Provide OpenVZ image for quattor server
-   Provide cut-down rpmlist for grid nodes?

### LAPP/LAL

-   Set up nightly build system for quattor components

### All

-   Review component writing howto -- recommend gettree method
-   Include list of files modified by a component
-   Analyse components to make it easier to start: common boilerplate
-   Need volunteer(s) to set up and host back up for content and code on
    SourceForge:
-   SVN
-   wiki
-   other ...?

## Wrap-up

Next meeting to be held in London (Morgan & Stanley), March 11-13, 2009.
