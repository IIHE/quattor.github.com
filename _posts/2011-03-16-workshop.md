# 11th Quattor Workshop - CERN - 16-18/3/2011

[Agenda](http://indico.cern.ch/event/118603/timetable#all.detailed#all.detailed).

## Quattor Status Report - M. Jouvin

See
[Slides](http://indico.cern.ch/getFile.py/access?contribId=16&sessionId=13&resId=0&materialId=slides&confId=118603).

## Core Tools

### Quattor Configuration Modules - L. Munoz Meijias

Recent addition

-   `ncm-ofed` (from Stijn): Infiniband configuration, very preliminary

Obsolete/suspect modules

-   `ncm-http`: used only at CERN
-   `ncm-tomcat`: used only at CERN
-   `ncm-tomcat2`: who uses it?
-   `ncm-rproxy`: replaced by `ncm-squid`?
-   `ncm-smartd` and `ncm-smartd5`: same schema, what is the difference?

Component quality: testing is tedious, old bugs are often back...

-   CAF is a critical tool to help with component reliability
-   Can run commands, update/write files with traceability and a real
    test suite
-   LC status: still maintained, private copy in Quattor
-   LC::File should not be used directly, CAF::FileWriter and
    CAF::FileEditor instead
-   LC::Process no longer expands to a subshell: new version will allow
    to split command on whitespaces

`ncm-accounts`: rewritten twice in last 2 years, hope v6 will fix all
problems definitely

-   Very fast with large number of accounts
-   It correctly handles creation of user's home directories

`ncm-networks`: lot of complains, ugly code, need rewriting, must review
what the component should really do

-   Define IP config for network cards
-   Define bridge devices: required for virtualization support
-   Tuning of device parameters
-   Configuration of channel bonding: kernel module manipulations should
    be done with ncm-modprobes
-   Must work on diskless servers: no more restart of the network just
    for testing
-   TCP-parameters should be controlled by ncm-sysctl
-   IPv6 support: schema extension needed
-   Loic may try to look at it

`ncm-sudo`: CERN needs to be able to manage sudoers.ldap

`ncm-useraccess`: proposal to remove PAM-based ACL support

-   Mistake to have put it here, use `ncm-pam` instead

`ncm-authconfig` rewritten with LDAP support

`ncm-modprobe`: support for SL4 to SL6

-   SL3 support removed

`ncm-spma` v2: new incompatible schema, 2-phase upgrade needed

`ncm-chkconfig`: problem with removal of ability to specify both `on`
and `off`

-   Need ability to say "set service on to runlevel ",4,5 but off at
    other levels"

CCM: no changes since Feb. 2009, MS patches still not there?

-   Still no support for local profiles required for easier testing

`ncm-ncd`: version 1.3 by MS allows subclassing

-   Some components won't work with 1.2 in the future
-   Should try to enable `-t` in Perl to get warnings about dangerous
    components
-   `cdp-listend` and `ncm-cdispd` should drop privileges when not
    needed

RHEL6 support: another platform to maintain... introduces Perl 5.12

-   Major language changes but backward compatible
-   Use stricter modes in Perl 5.12 to identify improvements needed to
    existing components
-   Don't jump to quickly into new, incompatible features
-   Core libraries (CAF, LC) are not affected by the changes

Some actions needed

-   Identify obsolete components and move them to another location
    (delete them?)
-   Identify and fix components using backquotes to spawn commands
    instead of CAF::Process
-   Do a Quattor component release? or official/recommended list of
    components?
-   Can the new build tools help with this?
-   What process?

Luis will no longer be able to (significantly) contribute as he's
leaving CERN...

### Aquilon and other MS Developments Status - N. Williams

Main developments: integration with ESX through QRD

Profile signature: decided it was not the way to go, just encrypting
profiles over the wire through Krb host keytab

ncm-network: MS would like to be involved in rewrite, ready to
contribute

ncm-modprobes: difficulties with last version because of removal of
shell expansion

RHEL6: found various issues, some of them not identified at CERN (in
particular AII-related ones)

-   Goal: support ready in a few months, fixing problems as they are
    discovered

Aquilon: will add support for "clusters" in a way similar to SCDB to
help with use of QWG templates.

Will start looking at support Solaris 11 in the future.

-   Probably not before autumn

May also look at feeding their internal Windows management system from
Quattor.

### Pan Compiler Status - C. Loomis

v8.5-7:

-   Warning about all v9 deprecated feature
-   Fix for NS object templates
-   Fix for panc on Windows
-   Introduction of "prefix" statement to simplify paths in templates
-   In action from where it is declared to the end of the template,
    several possible in the same template but not recommended

v9

-   v9.0: available soon, development version
-   v9.2: early summer, production version

v9 main new features for the first versions

-   Fixed generation of annotation output for better handling of
    namespaces
-   Fix command line script
-   New ant task and maven plugin

v9 roadmap

-   Investigate use of clojure (lisp-like over JVM): better
    implementation of mem mgt in panc, agent model similar to panc task
    mgt, memorization of file system stats...
-   May allow to simplify/streamline panc code
-   Focus on code maintainability rather than new features
    (none requested)

Support

-   v8.4.7 is the last v8 version
-   v8.2.x is now unsupported, please upgrade
-   v9.x: all new developments in these releases

Requests from the discussion

-   debug() outside DML (Nick)
-   Produce a "map" of the includes without executing (compiling)
    them (Nick)
-   Difficult when using loadpath
-   clojure may help

## QWG Templates

### QWG Templates Update - M. Jouvin

See slides.

### Nagios Templates - R. Starink

Almost done

-   monitoring/nagios/config: server configuration
-   RPM includes
-   Apache configuration

Difference between generic and local configuration: most work done
locally, still need to be merged

Pnp4Nagios: service tpl needs site modifications

Hierarchy of Nagios servers: optional

Grid monitoring: based on EGEE/EGI work

-   Uses YAIM, not easy to integrate into existing QWG templates. More
    discussion required.
-   Replace ncm-yaim by ncm-filecopy?
-   Not generic

Summary

-   No visible progress yet but some progress behind the scenes
-   Merge into SVN requires time and dedication: would like to test
    results
-   Grid monitoring to be done after completion of base work

### LEMON - I. Fedorko

Exception sensor: runs on the monitored node to report abnormal
conditions (based on local conditions and metrics collected by other
sensors on the node) and optionally run a corrective action.

LEMON usage: CERN (several instances: one at CC + online farms), CNAF,
MS

Backends

-   Supported: Oracle and flat-files
-   No alarming possible with flat-files: rely on PL/SQL (available for
    most DBs)
-   Postgres/MySQL support should be possible to add as internally LEMON
    is DB vendor independent

LEMON usage at CERN: 11K entities (8K machines), 5+ Knodes with 150-200
metrics

-   Performance monitoring
-   Application monitoring
-   Infrastructure metrics: temperature, power...
-   5 core sensors covering 60% of measurements
-   1 LEMON server (+1 for historical data)

Quattor management of LEMON

-   LEMON agent configured with ncm-fmonagent
-   LEMON client authenticated to the server via the SINDES host
    certificates

Current activities

-   Federation of instances (worked with MS)
-   Virtual machines monitoring: Quattor used to generate images
    (golden nodes) leading to several VM instances sharing the same
    SINDES certificate
-   Also customized sensors for hypervisors
-   New LEMON web for better scalability and improved flexibility (more
    dynamic operations)

Future

-   Consolidation of monitoring activities at CERNIT, including
    experiment support
-   New DB schema for increased scalability
-   DB data export for data mining
-   Exception classification for alarming
-   Remote instances (monitoring of remote T0)
-   Probably integrating with Nagios for collection
-   Interfacing to Nagios: interested by ideas/experiences
-   Interfacing with Windows monitoring

LEMON development team at CERN: 0.5 to 1.5 FTE

-   Enough for maintenance for CERN usage
-   Not enough to do major reengineering: a problem as the use cases
    have changed
-   Consolidating monitoring activities (and manpower) is one direction
-   Interacting with other tools is the other direction

## CMS Experience with Quattor - J. A. Coarasa Perez

CMS online computing infrastructure requirements

-   Complete autonomy from CERN IT and network
-   Myrinet core network
-   Redundant services (2 different computing rooms distant of 200m),
    managed remotely from a central control room
-   Fast configuration turnaround
-   Ability to read from electronics at 100 kHz (100 GB/s)
-   Computing power to do data selection (2 GB/s output): \~2500 cores
-   Enough disk storage for 2 days: \~300 TB
-   Spare computers for quick replacement in case of failure (\~200)

Limited manpower: \~5 FTEs

Quattor is the core configuration management tool

-   Computers installed through Quattor but not using AII
-   Based on a (very) old Quattor version: 1.3
-   panc 6
-   RPM repositories hosted on NetApp filers with 6 SWrep servers
-   Performance: 10mn for compiling the whole 2500 machines
-   Time to deploy changes: \~10 mn (cdp notification used)
-   Reinstallation of 1K machines in 1h 1/4
-   Problem when SWrep servers were overloaded: spma timeout, no retry

Well defined template structure/layout (CMS specific)

Some CMS-specific developments

-   Dropbox for RPMs to allow people without Quattor expertise to update
    their SW in a traceable/reproducible way
-   Buggy components requiring workarounds (in particular for
    configuration removal)
-   Copy of configuration files to individual computers: copyd
-   Network configuration derived from DNS
-   RPMs used to create users
-   Web frontend to CDB configuration: template summarizer (parsing part
    of the profiles according to CMS way of configuring systems)
-   Software Update Tools: allow to update existing RPM in a group of
    computers (dropbox)
-   Upgrade or downgrade
-   Allows to rollback changes
-   Allow to check the status of the update
-   Perform checks on the RPM: already exists, not named properly...
-   Cannot be used to add a new RPM to the configuration: need to
    request addition of a new RPM
-   Only one person can run it at any time
-   Ability to run commands on a set of computers selected based on the
    use of a given template (like a type)

Conclusions

-   Quattor has been and is scalable to CMS needs
-   Not always as flexible as we'd like...

## Security

### SINDES Update - J. Dudziec

Certificate authority + secured file store.

Several issues requiring major reengineering

-   Only one SINDES user per system: no fine grain permissions for
    different users
-   Impossible to delete a file in the file store
-   Impossible a to move a machine from one cluster to another one
-   No support of subclusters
-   Unattended installation of machines not really possible: SINDES must
    be notified first

Progress since last workshop

-   Documentation on Quattor wiki
-   Code in SF with Apache2 license: still some issues (currently GPL)

SINDES v2 overview

-   Apache + SOAP
-   Internal DB for SINDES-specific information, eg. SINDES items
    (file + permissions)
-   Interaction with CDB through CDB2SQL to retrieve host
    information (eg. cluster/subcluster)
-   Krb used in replacement for SINDES CA for accessing SINDES server
-   Same client tool for users and hosts
-   Major improvement of code maintainability: 300 LOC instead of 10K in
    v1
-   Site-specific authorization modules to use whatever is appropriate
    at the site: CERN is using egroups, LANDB...
-   flexible item to host/cluster/subcluster mapping

Impact of SINDES CA removal: not necessarily more difficult to setup Krb
than SINDES CA...

-   SINDES CA adds a lot of complexity to SINDES code, not
    necessarily secure...
-   May consider adding support for optional other authentication
    methods, like certificates

Unattended installation

-   CERN: initial keytab download allowed if request coming from low
    ports and reverse DNS matches (no time window)
-   MS: adding a time-window feature to Krb

Only client available in v1 is command line, other APIs under
consideration for v2

-   May change the implication of a GPL license

### Quattor and CERN Security - L. Munoz Meijias

Applying SW updates

-   CERN IT preparing snapshots of recommended versions every week,
    users picks one of them
-   In case of major security vulnerability/problem, CERN Security can
    make mandatory an update

Challenge of managing 250M accounts... in particular challenge of
maintaining ACLs

-   Unix group are not an appropriate solution: difficult to maintain,
    no recursive groups
-   LDAP + egroups used to implement the required features
-   egroups: logical name for a set of accounts, recursive
-   Quattor used to configure LDAP authorization
-   Still an issue to configure non LDAP-aware services

Access to accounts: mainly through Krb (+PAM)

-   SSH keys are a potential problem in case of computers compromised
    outside CERN, no way to know if they have been removed from all CERN
    computers
-   Privileged accounts: no possibility to ssh out from a privilege
    account
-   Need to restrict more accounts (apache, oracle)
-   Would like to restrict the allowed origin of incoming connections to
    privilege accounts

Multi-factor authentication: no uniform way of doing it, work in
progress to make progress on this

Logging of all commands and command arguments on sensitive systems using
`snoopy`

-   Intercept calls to execv and sent to syslog what is executed

Monitoring with alarming of \~12 security-sensitive files per computer

-   File permissions

## Development Process and Tools

### End of current sprint

See
[wiki](/meeting).

### Maven-based Build Tools - C. Loomis

Tools available

-   Build plugins, configuration for full configuration module
-   Archetype to build config for a new configuration module
-   Creates tarballs as well as RPMs

[Documentation](/development/00-basics.html)
available.

Usage status

-   pan
-   pan-templates
-   ncm-query an ncm-cdispd: prototype available

Making releases

-   "Magic" to do a release with Maven is easy:
    `mvn clean release:prepare release:perform`
-   Builds, tags, uploads packages, makes "site", increments version
-   But requires some specific permissions: write access to nexus
    repository for packages, write access to SF website for "site"
    information
-   Allow anyone from command line to make release?
-   Use continuous integration server (eg. Hudson) for releases?
    Preferred solution... but it is an additional service (not available
    on SF, need to manage identities)

Continuous integration service: much more benefits than just the release
making

-   Not necessary a big deal to set up the service
-   Already have the StratusLab experience
-   Is LAPP ready to do it (previously in charge of build
    infrastructure)?

More discussion tomorrow? Attempt to start a Hudson server?

### Development Process Discussion

Generally good feeling for those who participated

-   But not a very good feeling about EVO
-   Let's test the MS audio system for next standups

Meeting day and time: Thursday 2pm CET is not necessarily the best slot

-   Start a Doodle to find another possible slot, preferably during the
    morning
-   Wednesday may be a good choice, avoid Monday/Friday

Sprint duration: 1 month, smaller backlog

-   Monthly meeting to close the sprint and have the user interaction
    slot

Configuration module management: how to know/update what is the
recommended (stable) version to use?

-   No great idea...
-   Involve manual steps/work
-   Must be sustainable...
-   To be reviewed when we have converted all configuration modules to
    use Maven tools and have a continuous integration server in place.

Migration from SVN to Git: is it desirable? if yes, which steps?

-   StratusLab feedback: required a bit of effort for SVN users but
    several benefits at the end
-   Smaller, more specific repositories: smaller number of users with
    write access per repository
-   External references are really external to the repository
-   At SF, all users with write access in the project have write access
    to Git repositories by default but can be restricted per repository
-   Short term steps: new projects (eg. SINDES) in Git, panc moved from
    SVN to Git
-   Need a candidate with interaction between several developers:
    CCM-related things (ccm, ncm-cdispd, ncm-ncd, QuattorFS), AII and
    its plugins

## RHEL6

### CERN Experience

-   Path to install perl modules has changed: fixed by Luis for every
    Perl modules in SVN
-   Now installed in /usr/lib/perl, that applications are not supposed
    to use (not used by anybody)
-   Using standard installation place makes RPM OS-version dependent
-   Use /opt/quattor/lib/perl: upgrade ncm-ncd to look in both places
-   `rpmt-py` broken by 2 changes in standard Python RPM bindings: fixed
    by Christos
-   `curl` bug breaking SINDES and potentially anything using `wget`:
    certificate not looked in the right place
-   No workaround/fix yet
-   No impact known yet on Quattor itself
-   `ncm-grub` doesn't update the kernel after a kernel upgrade and
    %post script in RPM is failing
-   Christos will try to look at this
-   Also a need to add kernel architecture to grub command
-   `SELinux`: issue with rpmt-py, need to be documented on Quattor wiki
-   LDAP configuration is now in another place with another layout
    (previous information as a string now several tokens):
    ncm-authconfig has to be enhanced
-   Difficult to split the existing string in SL6 tokens: site specific
-   Rework the schema to have something more appropriate to handle
    different platforms?
-   Luis will try to summarize the problem and possible solutions on
    quattor-devel
-   Not clear if others are using LDAP for authentication...
-   Time synchronization in virtual machines run on HyperV: need to run
    new `ntpdate` service during startup to force synchronization
-   Initial time seems to be UTC...
-   ncm-modprobe: modprobe configuration files changed their location,
    new attribute in the schema to specify this location
-   Need to be handled by OS configuration templates
-   ncm-symlinks: use of last version required

### AUTH

-   A few fixes to be committed

### MS

-   Pb with AII file system partitioning (caches not flushed or
    something like that): thinking at using standard Anaconda for this,
    driving it from Quattor config
-   In the past, issues with Anaconda's handling of file system
    partitioning
-   ncm-pam issue, about to commit the fix

### Discussion

RHEL6 raises the question of the potential changes that may be required
for multiple-platform support

-   MS wants to restart Solaris port
-   Some components may be valid only on one platform: how to prevent
    them to be used on the wrong one
-   Bind the path in configuration to something that prevents its use

## Conclusions - Next Workshop

Next workshop in Strasbourg.

-   Best candidates look week 41 (10-14/10) and 42 (17-21/10)
