Packages are available from our [yum repository](http://yum.quattor.org/14.6.0/), both the RPMs and the repository metadata are signed with [my GPG key](http://yum.quattor.org/GPG/RPM-GPG-KEY-quattor-jrha).

As always, many thanks to everyone who contributed!

The next release should be 14.8.0, the [backlog](http://www.quattor.org/release/) for which is already huge.

Main New Features and Fixes
---------------------------

* AII can install both 13.1.x (SPMA-managed) and 14.x (YUM-managed) machines: this is now the **recommended** and **only supported** version of AII.
A site updating to 14.6.0 is recommended to upgrade its AII server first: this is the only version of AII capable of installing 14.6.0 machines.

* `ncm-cdispd` now properly reexecutes failed components every time a new profile is received, even though their configuration was not changed.
Previous versions were not doing this and this could result in a machine staying in a partially configured state.

* Grid template library also received a significant number of fixes for UMD-3 services. One of them is related to ncm-xrootd being blocked during
restart of xrootd services with the effect of stalling ncm-ncd and thus preventing further deployment (until the ncm-ncd time out) and
letting xrootd stopped.

Known issues
------------

* `ncm-xrootd`: the fix describes above unfortunately contains a mistake that let xrootd disk instances unmanaged by xrootd startup script after
executing the component (see https://github.com/quattor/configuration-modules-grid/pull/29). If you run into this problem, you may want to get the
fixed version (that will be part of 14.8) from http://quattorsrv.lal.in2p3.fr/packages/site/ncm-xrootd-14.6.1-SNAPSHOT20140716143750.noarch.rpm:
this will require you to edit cfg/quattor/14.6.0/components/xrootd/config.pan to update the RPM version.
