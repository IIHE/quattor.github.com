title: Upgrading to the Yum-based SPMA
category: documentation
---

Since Quattor 13.02 we have an entirely rewritten package manager,
based on Yum.

The initial page describing the migration from SPMA package deployment to YUM
package deployment has been revised and enhanced to reflect the improvements of
YUM integration into Quattor. Refer to the [new page](/documentation/2014/03/24/spma-yum-migration.html)
to get more information.
