# 7th Quattor Workshop - London - 11-13/3/09

See
[Agenda](https://indico.cern.ch/event/50010/timetable/#all.detailed).

## Site Reports

### LAL - G. Philippon

### Grid Ireland - S. Childs

Not much changes in the number of admins or resources

-   Virtualization of most nodes (Xen)

Developments in monitoring:

-   NAgios + Ganglia
-   MonAMI to feed Ganglia from DPM and Torque
-   LEMON : upgraded to lemon-web on SL5

Many tools upgraded : checkdeps, quatview

-   ncm-accounts massive speedup

SCDB : merge "hierarchical site" model into trunk

Issues:

-   Get network and file sytems fully under Quattor control
-   Consistent scheme for monitoring in Quattor
-   Dummy WN speedup trick integrated into the compiler

### NIKHEF - R. Starink

4 clusters: 300 machines

-   Currently 5 people involved with Quattor

SCDB + local changes: deployment not done by SCDB bu by local tools to
allow deployment of a specific machine

-   Related to historical way of managing systems at NIKHEF but has the
    disadventage that a postponed change deployment may break something
    later on some other nodes...

Xen: 7 hosts, 38 guests

-   Based on QWG but issues with host and guests in different clusters:
    workaround found

Monitoring entirely based on Nagios with 1 master and 3 slaves

-   Based on QWG but some mods to handle hierarchy of servers that are
    willing to share

panc v7 to v8 transition: no problem but no performance improvement
observed

-   Very happy of new logging features

NCM components:

-   ncm-openvpn to configure server and clients
-   ncm-yaim: complete refactoring/rewriting, new features, some
    backward incompatible changes

Issues:

-   WN compilation speed-up has some pb with compile-time dependency
-   Strength of community with increase usage: what about the ability to
    support everybody?

### LAPP - E. Fede

Quattor server is running on a VMware virtual machine

-   110 profiles
-   4 people using it

Running autobuild of RPMs for NCM components and other core components
from SourceForge

-   <http://lapp.in2p3.fr/Quattor>
-   trunk and tags/latest
-   repodata available from YUM

### CERN - V. Lefébure {#cern---v.-lefebure}

Main instance: 7500 profiles in 139 clusters

-   +1200 increase
-   1900 profiles corresponding to machines not managed by Quattor
-   Running the last version of CDB, panc v8 ready
-   v8: 20% improvement in compile time but not yet in production. all
    know issues solved
-   Problem of use of RECORD type by some components
    (ncm-httpd, ncm-tomcat....)

Xen-based virtualization: support for SLC5 hypervisors ready

Issues of number of users: 65 ACL groups

Package list templates: working on automation

-   Use of comps.xml
-   Automatic detection of missing dependencies

CDB2SQL: Python version fast but buggy, no manpower to fix it, reverted
to previous version

### Morgan & Stanley - N. Williams

In production now: AQB, AQDB, LEMON

-   7500 nodes, compile at 10 minutes (8-core machine) but aii-shellfe
    --notify at 1h (with patches not yet committed) !
-   5 template admins
-   New building just commissionned and expect to double the number of
    machine in the next months, plan to keep one server (+1
    for redundancy)

Issues:

-   Format change of XML profiles painful: dropping LINK support forces
    "big-bang" changes
-   Configuration success feedback: thinking at implementing a DB of
    last time a component was run, updated by ncm-ncd/ncm-cidspd that
    could be compared with the timestamp of the last configuration

Will submit code now via SourceForge

-   Waiting for approval to open source : AQDB, FUSE interface to
    configuration browsing, AII, CCM patches

### UAM - Laura del Caño {#uam---laura-del-cano}

Luis left, Laura is his replacement.

Proposal of tasks that UAM could handle:

-   Maintenance of monitoring tools
-   openvz support
-   AII

5 clusters

-   Use of ant local tasks for template management
-   Performance tests of new machines configured with Quattor

New component in progress:

-   ncm-amanda to configure Amanda backup SW
-   ncm-pnp4nagios

Some local developments:

-   Postgresql DB to store machine info and group them into categories +
    ant local task to generate the profile and some other
    templates (monitoring) for the machine
-   SinDes alternative used to manage secured access to profile
    (AII hook)

### Greek Grid - D. Zilaskos

1 Quattor server to manage 2 clusters representing 133 machines spanning
13 subnets

-   4 Xen hosts, 19 guests
-   SVN server installed with Trac
-   3 admins + 2 new people who recently joined

Developpements and issues:

-   Wiki guides for Quattor newbies
-   New components: still in progress... some services like Hydra
    evolving very quickly
-   Involvement in OAT benefits as work is implemented and tested
    locally with Quattor
-   Thinking at an administration model for Southern Europe based on
    GRIF/GRID Ireland experience
-   Lot of small sites, very limited effort available...

### CNAF - A. Chierici

90% of the templates adapted to the new schema

-   Inspired by QWG
-   Next step is migration of gLite nodes to SLC5

Xen used on 3 servers providing 16 cores each

-   LHCb T2 running on Xen
-   Quattor used to configure the profiles of guests but Dom0 managed by
    hand
-   Investigating KVM

Planning to install soon new ncm-yaim and ncm-accounts

CDB vs. SCDB: still thinking about migration but need to investigate the
impact for the users

-   Is CDB still supported after ME left ?
-   Who will take care of new core release ?

Presenting a poster about Quattor at CHEP: anyone who could help to
present it ?

One new people to help with Quattor at CNAF (Elisabetha)

-   All new sysadmins teached to use Quattor

## Aquilion Drive Through - W. Hertlein

Aquilon is an architecture to address system management at M&S, in
particular scalability, management delegation, application-centric
management...

-   Goal is to install hundred of machines without any manual
    intervention

AQDB is the CDB replacement: no direct interaction between users and
templates, everything goes through the Aquilon broker (AQB)

-   Aquilon configuration stored into AQDB

Workflow of provisionning machines:

-   Rack is the unit of work: racks delivered cabled
-   Limited number of vendors and models
-   When racks is powered on, top of rack (tor\_switch) switch send a
    DHCP request and receive a temporary address that will allow to
    configure it after discoverin its type
-   Switch entered in AQDB
-   DNS integration : all servers configured with the same information
-   DNS DB built from a periodic dump of AQDB (every 3h)
-   DHCP integration: a DHCP server set to server a specific set of
    machines
-   Configuration built from a periodic dump of AQDB
-   Discovering machine: done by scripts scanning the tor\_switch an
    dquerying it with snmp get
-   Create a machine entry in AQDB for each discovered MAC entry
-   After a machine has been entered in AQDB, create a machine
    plenary (PAN) template describing the HW
-   Machine plenary template is an equivalent of SCDB hardware/machine +
    the service/personnality
-   Creating hosts: logical entry for the host created and associated
    with a plenary template
-   IP is derived by choosing an available IP from the tor\_switch
    subnet and put in the plenary template to avoid an IP address change
    triggers recompilation of another host
-   Wait for the propagation of previous information, in particular DNS:
    may take a couple of hours
-   Next day build out the hosts binding host to required services and
    use panc to compile the template
-   Invoke aii-shellfe to switch over the install pxe image (done
    through AQB)
-   DNS + Krb propagation delay: looking for some optimizations in the
    future
-   Finishing the build process: a script runs on the newly built host
    to update its information in AQDB
-   Record any management interfaces found and if successful update the
    status information
-   Grid hand-off: after successful build of a host, it is transferred
    to an application groups
-   Deployment schedules are set up in advance
-   Use personality to set up a host with application defaults
-   Spread hosts for a group over several racks for better resilience

Managing services: a service may have several instance

-   1 service instance is bind to a host

Monitoring hosts to meet SLA

-   Hosts are monitored by a daemon that does periodic snmp sweep of all
    the hosts
-   Hosts are grouped by personality with a threshold of hosts allowed
    to be offline
-   Host personality also defines a reboot schedule: potential previous
    threshold violation will prevent the reboot
-   Include some draining capabilities
-   LEMON is enabled as a service to provide visualization of aggregated
    metrics
-   LEMON configured from Aquilon to guarantee consistency

Updating personalities involve working on a local copy of the
personality and creating a new temporary one (AQ domain), compiling it
with a fake profile and putting the change back into AQDB

-   Currently no check enforced by 'aq put' that the new
    version compiles. Rely on conventions...
-   A test host can be associated with the new personality and
    reconfigured to validate the changes
-   AQ then allows to merge changes into a production personality and
    reconfigure all nodes using it

## Monitoring

### Monitoring Templates in QWG - S. Kenny

LEMON:

-   NCM components: fmonagent, oramonserver
-   Templates: standard/monitoring/lemon
-   Web front-end via filecopy

Nagios:

-   NCM components: nagios, ncg
-   Templates: standard/monitoring/nagios
-   A few changes to support Nagios 3
-   Hosts created from HW DB
-   Services defied as separate templates and added to
    NAGIOS\_SERVICE\_TEMPLATES variable but not very scalable
-   ncm-ncg currently being developped to produce an input file for WLCG
    NCG which generates the service definition: looks promising

Ganglia: configured with filecopy

-   Would be better to have a component generating the required config
    file on client and server from the site hierarchi description

MonAMI: configured with filecopy

Currently, every monitoring tool has its own configuration. Ideally
monitoring schema should be mostly tool-independant. Proposed model
based on current LEMON config:

-   Host: coming from DB\_MACHINE
-   Cluster: group of nodes sharing the same node types
-   Super-cluster:
-   Need to be part of the information in the node profile so that it
    can be used by several components
-   May be connected with some representation of M&S personalities into
    the schema

## Core Components

### PAN Compiler - C. Loomis

Code hosted on SourceForge since 8.2.6

-   Bug tracking moved to SF too

Production version is v8

-   v7 deprecated
-   8.2.3 : CDB compatibility, annotation
-   8.2.4 : selective debugging
-   8.2.7 introduces prepend/append functions to replace push/npush

Outstanding bugs:

-   Race condition in validation
-   Corner cases with unintuitive behaviour
-   Enforce final flag in structure templates: no real request...

Enhancement requests (in priority order):

1.  Restricted include (aka entitlements)
2.  Add perf tips to documentation
3.  XInclude directive to replace Embedded
4.  Add OBJECT to debug() and error() output
5.  Add prefix/define statements to shorten literal paths
6.  Internationalize error messages
7.  Enable/disable debugging from within pan
8.  Allow include to take a list (from M&S)

Other ideas/wishes:

-   Better Eclipse integration: editor, debugger, dialog boxes to select
    options for ant/pan
-   Ability to include a file which is not a template inside a template
    as an alternative to `<<EOF`
-   File name should be relative to the loadpath as for other templates
-   Rework string escaping handling for automatic escaping by the
    compiler and a prefix in the string to know if it has been escaped
    or not without ambiguity

Restricted include statements: design questions

-   Allow the scope of configuration tree changes to be specified when
    including a template ?
-   -   : require modification of templates to do entitlement
-   Specified allowed areas of tree ? or restricted (disallowed) areas ?
-   Need both, discusse if exclude before include or the opposite
-   Can '/a' be fixed but '/a/b/c' be changed ?
-   Enforce entitlement on loadpaths ?
-   What about variables ?
-   Allow wildcards and/or regular expressions on the template names ?

### NCM Components - N. Williams

ncm-cron: more smearing

-   `frequency` may be replaced by `timing`, a nlist allowing to specify
    a targert (eg. interval into hours) + a smear interval
-   hours/days/month/... are strings that allow expressions and are
    validated
-   If present `timing` takes precedence over `frequency`

ncm-download: retrieve URL

-   funtionality similar to filecopy but contents download with curl
    form a URL
-   Support proxies
-   Can use `spnego` support into curl for authenticated access to URL,
    using Krb principal for example
-   Support global definition of http server to use and relative URLs
-   Subclassable: a method allow to tell the component the configuration
    path to use, instead of the default, allowing the component to be
    called by another component for one specific file
-   An idea to reuse in other components like ncm-filecopy
-   A problem with ncm-ncd which might not match exception

CCM: support for local CCM DB format

-   Specified with `dbformat`: can be `GDBM_File`, `DB_File`, `CDB_File`
    (compact DB, nothing to do with Quattor CDB!)
-   Format is stored in file `.fmt` close to `.db` file: only the
    writers need to take care of it, read is properly handled by CCM
    library
-   Download ''if-modified-since'' local disk version, ignoring the
    mtime in CDP notification message
-   ccm-fetch now uses the library coming from ccm-fetch.new (3
    years old!)

ncm-cdispd/ncd: would like to add configuration status feedback

-   `/var/lib/ncm` contains an entry per component:
-   If the file is empty, component must run
-   If run successfully, delete the files
-   If failed, write the exception into the file
-   If a component is inactive, ncm-cdispd remove the file for the
    component in `var/lib/ncm` unconditionnaly (without checking
    its contents)

spma/aii-ks: randomization of proxy choosen when multiple available

-   If the AII server processing the kickstart file is in the list of
    proxies, use it
-   Support for a list of "installack" servers, requested in // to
    ensure consistency when several AII servers are used in //
-   Require ncm-nscd start before starting configuration to ensure name
    service can be restarted without impact on the configuration process

AII: --notify, --firmware, use\_fqdn

-   `--notify`: automatically configures anything thant needs
    configurating, based on `profiles-info.xml`
-   `--firmware`sets alternate pxe boot target to boot relevant firmware
    installer based on HW information from the profile
-   Schema change required
-   Reset done by another external tool
-   Global lock no longer requested for aii-shellfe, only for aii-dhcp.
-   Only a lock on the specific client host
-   Fixed caching, created multi-level cache hierarchy where first level
    is the DNS domain name

## QWG

## SourceForge Migration - S. Child

Main source repository now on SF as a snapshot (without history)

-   22 developpers registered: many active developpers still missing
-   Send your SF account to Stephen
-   Build tools basically working but unmaintanable now that ME left

quattor.org now is a wiki (MediaWiki)

-   An account is required to edit pages
-   Feel free to add new pages for experimental stuff without linking it
    to other pages

Issue tracker used only by panc so far.

-   Would be better if we could use the Trac one as it seems to be
    available on SF

Download menu: mainly pan currently, difficult to automate updates

Documentation menu is unused as this is only plain web pages

Mailing lists still hosted at CERN: next candidate for migration

-   Create new lists with current subcribers
-   Block submission on mailing lists at CERN

QWG code and documentation still hosted at LAL

-   Trac now available on SF, test it as it would be much easier
-   Check if Trac DB can be reimported and how to migrate SVN (snapshot
    would be acceptable).

User branches: no problem, create them in branches, currently unused.

Announcing new tags on the mailing list: no consensus, not sure it will
be manageable

-   Would be preferable to have a dashboard, let's discuss it as part of
    QBT future

## Quattor Datawarehousing - N. Williams

Quattor and databases:

-   Managing relations between objects and metadata having integrity
    constraints should involve a relational model and generally
    connected to enterprise
-   Managing configuration behaviours should be the task of an
    appropriate language like PAN
-   What is configured where ? require a DB like CDB2SQL
-   Not only display of existing configuration with different views but
    also historical views

QuatView: uploads selected information from profiles into MySQL,
displays with a web browser

-   Big limitation : single timestamp
-   Currently only MySQL but should be easy to use other back-ends
-   Recent additions/enhancements to have the web client much more
    flexible and usable, eg. search on every column

CDB2SQL: similar features to QuatView but without the web tool to browse
the DB

-   Use DBI API
-   Use DB bulk insert
-   Implemented as a server module that can run anywhere
-   Detect changed profiles
-   `-ora` version is in fact not Oracle specific (MySQL is still
    the default) but has a lot of Oracle specific additions
    (mainly views)
-   `-dist` version more recent and faster but currently Orcale
    specific, although not hard to change
-   cdb2sql just schedule uploads of XML that are done by a
    multi-threaded process

Server modules:

-   CDB and SCDB send CDP notification that profiles have changed
-   SCDB uses a CCM CDP notification sent to the host affected
-   CDB send a message to a server in charge of taking appropriate
    actions for the affected clients
-   Involves calling cdb2sql-sync

'''Proposal''': use cdb2sql with Quatview web interface

-   Extend schema to provide versioned data : from underlying SCM ? from
    XML ?
-   Build into the profile by panc ?
-   Include revision tag in data
-   Publish datawarehouse to AII instead of notifying datawarehouse and
    AII in //

## Quattor and Inventory Management

### CERN - V. Lefébure {#cern---v.-lefebure-1}

CDB2SQL to retrieve information from Quattor CDB. All other applications
using DB produced by CDB2SQL

CERN specific schema extension to describe the HW.

-   Include the template name describing the HW
-   Track warranty contract ID
-   Track power consumption
-   Also used for machines not managed by Quattor to keep track of them
    in the inventory

CC Tracker: displays a geographical view of the machines managed by
Quattor

HMW: application to handle installation, move, rename, retire... of a
machine

-   Form-based application with lot of parameters pre-filled with the
    spread sheet delivered with the machines
-   Interconnect with other DB/apps involved: Remedy, LAN DB

Request for new HW done by users using a Web form

### Morgan & Stanley Asset Management - S. d'Aquila

''Note: M&S interested to hear feedback on how this work may be useful
for the community.''

Aurora was relying heavily on AFS

-   Configuration lives into hand-crafted files, prone to human error,
    impossible to browse in a reasonnable amount of time
-   Poor data quality of data about hosts
-   No fine-grained entitlement

Aquilon design goals:

-   Model systems by what make them similar rather than different
-   Manage resource at a higher level with no manual intervention and
    application-centric view
-   Avoid NIH syndrom
-   Vendor neutral with the option to open source
-   Build a system it is easy to interact with
-   Mix of declarative configuration (configure this machine as a
    mail server) and proscriptive configuration wher the entire
    configuration is under the control of a configuration
    management tool.
-   Ensure consistency between server and clients configuration

Why use a DB:

-   Fast efficient retrieval of data with referential integrity
-   Concurrency control, transaction, fine-grain locking for free
-   Be a source of information for legacy systems

Technology choices:

-   Twisted Python: event driven network application framework
-   SqlAlchemy: object relational mapper and SQL toolkit

Assets managed:

-   Hardware: machines and their components
-   Real estate they occupy
-   Namespaces: DNS domains, resetved tcp/udp, users, groups
-   Services

Lot of effort put in architecture definition and taxonomy:

-   Personality: what is machine role ?
-   Archetype: philosophical basis behind the build process
-   Examples: Aquilon, Aurora, Aegis, Windows
-   Future: clusters of VMware, network gear, SAN/NAS devices...
-   Location:a flexible way of hierarchically organizing our stuff
    (regions, campus, building...)
-   Configuration assumption: it is usually better to use a service
    instance local rather than remote or at least as closest as possible

A system configuration is made of:

-   Hostname (and associated interfaces)
-   Archetype and its requirements
-   Personality
-   Services it uses structured as an ordered list of templates
-   For each service, define instances: a host providing the service,
    its location and the template associated
-   Service mapping responsible for automatic selection of instance
    based on requirements defined somewhere else like archetype,
    personality

Future directions:

-   Same kind of requirements for archetypes to personalities
-   Advanced entitlement and audit capabilities

## Quattor in Amazon Cloud - C. Loomis

AWS vs. Xen:

-   Network ocnfiguration: all machines have private and public IP
    addresses but users cannot predict or allocate them before starting
    the machine.
-   Network interface uses the private address for configuration
-   DNS contains only public address, not the private one
-   IP address can be changed on the fly when using Elastic IP
-   hostname command doesn't return the DNS name associated with the
    public IP address
-   Installation: PXE not supported for installation of the machine,
    must start from an existing machine image
-   Must use limited list of supported kernels: only RHEL5 kernels

Current config:

-   Quattor server in the cloud: quattor.stratuslab.org
-   Only packages and profiles, no AII. Only httpd
-   SVN at SixSq
-   Base VM image used already has the basic quattor client installed +
    a script run during first boot as part of init.d to do the first
    ccm-fetch and ncm-ncd

Issues and questions:

-   Multiple machines can use the same profile: easy and clean way to
    define only one WN per site.
-   Machine names not known at compile time : how to link batch server
    and clients, nfs server and clients ? How to handle late binding ?
-   Change notifications fail : no link between profile name and machine
    name
-   Allow machines to register for changes ?
-   Move to "chat room" (Jabber?) messaging for changes ?
-   Workflow: how to manage image disks, IP addresses, machine lifecycle
    ?
-   Should Quattor manage only image instead of machines ?

## Virtualization Update - S. Child

Xen:

-   ncm-xen pretty stable but needs some work
-   Should delete managed configuration files when removed from profile
-   Filesystems code should be removed and use ncm-filesystmes
-   QWG helper code: "database" mapping guests to
    hosts, xen/configure\_guests() function
-   configure\_guests() populates `/software/components/xen/domains`
    from guest templates, automatically set `/hardware/location` to the
    DOM0 host name
-   guests and host in different cluster: a SCDB workaround implemented
    by adding the guest clusters in `cluster.pan.includes`

Current virtualization deployment:

-   TCD and NIKHEF: Xen + QWG
-   NIKHEF has some local tricks for cross-cluster HW handling
-   CERN: Xen + enclosures
-   Enclosures are close to `XEN_DB` : a nlist of parents with their
    children as the value
-   M&S: VMware + XML injection from config into hypervisor
-   No way to manage VMware server with Quattor (black box)

openvz: used by UAM, currently in testing, configured with Quattor

VM migration: only proposal from Luis, on <http://quattor.org>

-   Is it within the scope of Quattor or should it be integrated in some
    new lifecycle workflow manager ?
-   Need to find concrete use case for VM migration ?

Enclosures: generic model for host/guests dependencies

-   VM, blades...
-   Move to it ?

## European FP7 Quattor Project - C. Loomis

Goal: get additional manpower to make some significant changes to
Quattor toolkit and do the documentation

-   Currently a strong community with several developpers
-   But no dedicated people: mainly fixing urgent problems

FP7 Infastructure calls in Sept. 09 related to EGI

-   One of them related to middleware, including tools and services for
    deployment

Institutional requirements:

-   Need to identify a lead member, CNRS could act
-   Must involve typically, at least 3-5 different countries
-   Partners must be legal bodies, including JRU
-   Both academic and commercial partners

Project requirements:

-   Scale of funding must fit in the call guidelines.
-   Usually significant matching effort required: european funding only
    covers 50-80% of the project cost
-   Matching resources may be people and manpower
-   Must have JRA, NA and SA componenents
-   Must include dissemination and sustainability plans: should fit
    easily with the SF move

Project outline proposed:

-   NA: management, quality control, dissemination/training
-   Pre-packaged appliance to ease starting with Quattor
-   SA: build and test infrastructure, release management
-   Focus on Quattor use for gLite, QWG may be a good link with
    production infrastructure
-   JRA: improvement of current tools, control of cloud and virtualized
    resources, full lifecycle management, IPv6 support
-   EU has a strong push on IPv6
-   For current tools, focus on move to API allowing language
    independance
-   Must take into account that SA activities are better funded than
    others

Concrete tasks for building the project:

-   Need to identify partners and the project activities they are
    interested in: must cover all major parts of the Quattor toolkit
-   Must define the roadmap for the new features we want
-   Determine plans for dissemination and sustainability

Timeline for preparing the project:

-   June: identify the partners and lead partner
-   Detailed outline of project by Sept.
-   Finalize project description and financial aspects by Dec.

## Improving Quattor's Accessibility - C. Loomis

Quattor jas a steep and difficult learning curve

-   Both for users and developpers
-   Some is linked to the comprehensive nature of the toolkit but not
    all
-   Some reasons include:
-   Inadequate documentation, despite the improvements
-   Treating Quattor as an all or nothing affairs
-   Leftovers from old projects

Inconsistent branding: `Quattor` name is very seldom seen in the
individual tools

-   Very difficult for new users/admins to identify Quattor parts:
    daemons, config file names...
-   Move all config files to `/etc/quattor`
-   Review acronyms and change those which are not useful
-   Need to decide what we want to change and what is the roadmap for a
    non disruptive change

Documentation:

-   Lack of a good overview document
-   Incomplete and often outdated
-   Difficult to relate to a particular release tool
-   Automate documentation as much as possible
-   For example, use annotation in templates to document ''public''
    variables

Tutorials:

-   Very important but material often outdated
-   Generally focused on managing a whole site with Quattor
-   Need some tutorials on how to incrementally add Quattor to an
    existing management infrastructure
-   Explore Amazon AWS as a way to provide testing resources to people
    who want to evaluate Quattor

Multiple APIs/Tools

-   Better document strength and weakness of similar tools (eg.
    SCDB/CDB)
-   Have a good justification for multiple tools
-   Need a way to mark deprecated components and APIs

Coding practices: have a set a coding practices (at least for Perl-based
components) with a good agreement but nearly completely unenforced

Missing functionalities

-   PAN: Eclipse-based editor and debugger
-   Components: lots of duplicated code for skeleton of component,
    cannot run component as standalone script
-   Hooks for monitoring Quattor status
-   Messaging infrastructure inside Quattor

MEthodology:

-   Agree on a list of problems
-   Evaluate te impact of fixing each of the problems
-   Implement them along with other developments
-   Automate as much as possible: prevent regressing problems that have
    been fixed

## Quattor SW Process - C. Loomis

Current situation:

-   Quattor build tools mostly standardized with some adhoc checks for
    conventions
-   Nightly build performed from trunk
-   No dashboard of current state of code base
-   Few automated tests of Quattor tools
-   Little gathering of documentation: script exists but need to be
    integrated into SF
-   No quality checks of the Perl code
-   panc is using Java findbugs, similar things exists for Perl

Continous build: suggest moving to system like Hudson

-   Language agnostic
-   Build when there is a code change
-   Can define multiple builds and hierarchies of builds
-   Provides a dashboard of current and past results
-   Must be done outside SF

Coding standards and development guidelines

-   Good documents from Luis but nothing to enforce them
-   Should start at running Perl::Critic:
    highly configurable, large set of code checks, possibility to
    include project specific requirements

Unit tests:

-   Having a good set of unit tests makes refactoring and changing code
    more reliable
-   Many choices for framework for Perl: Perl's own may be easiest
-   Need to implement in a way that many tests come along for free
-   Not easy for NCM components as the test should include the action
    done: need to add ability in underlying libraries to use another
    root
-   May be used for other purposes like configuring images

Documentation: something like Perl::Tidy may help to generate
documentation in a format easily usable in a central place

-   Can tidy perl code extracting POD documentation and producing HTML
    pages

Quattor build tools: contain many thing relating to code checking that
should be moved to more appropriate tools

-   Try to design a new generation of QBT starting with the core
    features of the current ones (probably tagging releases) and adding
    later checks with appropriate tools

## Future Features

Working groups of people collaborating in developments of new features,
before a final, complete release

-   Monitoring, visualization/datawarehousing, virtualization,
    messaging infrastructure...

Template viewer: evaluate how to move forward based on panc output

-   tplview still based on direct parsing of pan templates

## Conclusions

'''Decisions''':

-   Software contribution and fixes: code maintenance is a common
    responsability, everybody is allowed to commit a change in any
    component
-   No need to get permission from the maintainer
-   Maintainer is a person with a global overview able to help other
    peoples with their contributions and who may rev iew the changes

'''Actions''':

-   Merge monitoring nagios3/ templates into the main nagios/ templates:
    Guillaume/Michel
-   Short term: remove nagios3/ from branches
-   Migrate mailing lists to SF
-   Setup of Trac on SF: Michel
-   Migration of QWG/SCDB to SF: Stephen/Michel, medium priority
-   Roadmap and strategy for consistent naming of command names,
    config files...
-   Perl module namespace: N. William
-   Command names: Stephen, use `quattor-` as a common prefix
-   Config files: Michel, move to `/etc/quattor`
-   Proposal for a new generation QBT : Cal
-   Evaluate possibility of a chat room in SF for support and other
    real-time discussions
-   Software tools:
-   Autobuild: Eric to look at Hudson and other continous build system
-   Perl::Critic: Cal
-   Test frameworks: Nick
-   Perl::Tidy or similar tools: Stephen
-   Review "dummy WN" hack and try to reimplement in a more sensible
    way: Stephen
-   Prepare FP7 project: coordinated by Cal, expression of interest by
    others
-   Make schema more modular if possible: Cal

'''Next workshop''':

-   Proposal: Brussel for the next one, Greece for winter 2010
-   Fix the dates with a Doodle as soon as possible, target: end of
    October
-   Factor-out specific topics, like gLite templates (1/2 day before
    or after)
-   // sessions for specific working groups or topics
-   Plan 1 for FP7 project
-   Consider day or 2 tutorial
-   Co-located to allow contacts between developpers and users ?
-   Tutorials at LISA or same
-   Announce widely
-   Fill agenda early: name programe chairs, identify main topics
