# Quattor Workshop - CNAF (Bologna) - 30/9/2013-2/10/2013

[Agenda](http://indico.cern.ch/event/252955/timetable#all.detailed#all.detailed)

## Project Status - L. Munoz

Survey ran before the workshop

-   Significant improvement compared to previous ones
-   QWG : many were not able to move to QWG or forked a long time ago.
    We need to think more heavily at it.
-   Aquilon adoption making progress (2-3 sites)
-   Community support is perceived as good
-   Documentation: still the weak point, were not able to make
    significant progresses
-   LAL wiki: certificate problem still perceived as a barrier, a
    developer only resource

## Core modules

### Configuration Modules - L. Munoz

Releases

-   Count : nine releases, 3 of them tagged as stable
-   New releases are not mandatory
-   Need a releaser manager backup for Luis

Config modules: main activity is on the core components

-   Not much on grid components or on daemons
-   ncm-openldap and ncm-cups were resurrected

New features

-   Preliminary support for SSSD in authconfig
-   YUM-based SPMA ready for production
-   Hooks for ncm-ncd before and after execution of components

Metaconfig stuff

-   Ugent has schemas and templates for many services: would like to
    share them
-   But we can hardly promise backward compatibility

Work in progress

-   Policy-based component dispatching in ncm-ncd
-   Solaris port
-   ncm-network: still not much progress

### ncm-ncd hooks and policy-based component scheduling

See \[/wiki/Development/PrePostActionsNCMNCD proposal\].

Goal: execute some arbitrary actions before running all components and
after.

-   These actions will have no access to node profile
-   Specified by `run-init` and `run-finalize`in `/etc/ncm-ncd.conf`
-   An error during `run-init` will prevent executing components but
    `run-finalize` will run

Hooks may be used to implement site-specific policy for component
scheduling, allowing to filter out some components from the initial list
based on some local criteria

-   But what to do with dependencies if one is filtered out? Can be very
    complicated
-   Probably better/enough to implement a "everything or nothing"
    strategy: at least use case can be cleanly defined

Some use cases for executing only part of the configuration changes for
a component. Proposal:

-   Split component configuration into 2 different parts/subtree, e.g.
    `/software/components/filecopy` and
    `/software/components/filecopy-magic`
-   Bind `/software/components/filecopy-magic` to `type_filecopy`
-   Define a component alias name in `filecopy-magic` saying it will use
    component `filecopy` to execute the action
-   New field in `deps` structure
-   Filter out `filecopy-magic` in run-init hook
-   See
    <https://github.com/quattor/configuration-modules-core/issues/112>
    for discussion/implementation follow-up

### CDBSQL - Z. Sebestyen

Used at MS to produce/update a SQLite db every 2 hours with the AQDB
contents: used by users to query configuration rather than overloading
the broker.

-   Reused an older API from MS to query the DB

Code will be pushed to SF at some point

-   Still some concerns with pushing directly to GitHub

Still need to review if it could be integrated with QuatView to replace
the internal SQL generator in QuatView and deliver a generic web
front-end.

Also, may look at using a NoSQL db rather than SQLite.

-   May give some perf advantage for querying the db but may a price for
    the update

## Maker Quattor Easier

### Introduction - D. Zilaskos

Painful path for a new Quattor user

-   Go to website and click download: not exactly what was being
    looked for...
-   Try documentation: suggest to go to overview... just
    marketing blurb...

Should not dream of producing a polished documentation as we failed for
so long... but we can make things much easier if not very easy. Goal
should be to install a workable Quattor installation for testing in 30
mn!

-   Install from Quattor YUM repo
-   `yum install quattor-server`
-   `yum install quattor-client`?
-   Sample templates usable with minimum editing (host name,
    mac address) to install/bootstrap a first machine
-   For the first step, could be take control of already existing
    machines without doing the initial installation to avoid
    AII/kickstart difficulties
-   Panc book: improve the tutorial part

Documentation may be organized in 2 different parts:

-   Getting started: build/describe an optimized procedure for a user to
    start with Quattor both for evaluating AND setting up a production
    infrastructure (could then be used to produce an appliance)
-   Prerequisite hardware/site config
-   Install server: prefer Aquilon if mature enough. We don't want to
    attract new sites to SCDB.
-   Take control of a client (already installed): should include a basic
    configuration description that is as less intrusive as possible for
    the existing configuration
-   Mini-demonstration illustrating how to change some service
    configuration, for example ssh keys, account creations, add a RPM
-   Next steps
-   How to find docs and examples
-   Initial installation: AII/kickstart customization
-   Security
-   Customizing node configurations: common services and recipes
-   Document how to execute an arbitrary command with existing config
    modules like filecopy or metaconfig

Put documentation on GitHub: start with a non public (review) section

-   Review how to improve the documentation structure on gitHub: see
    documentation discussion later during the workshop

Documentation: activate robot indexing for Quattor wiki hosted at LAL

Timeline

-   Getting Started done at next workshop (April 2014)
-   Next steps after

Encourage adoption of new YUM-based ncm-spma: make it clear that YUM is
used in a completely standard way and that people may/must refer to YUM
docs for details on advance YUM management (like mirroring).

### QWG Status - G. Philippon

Recent changes

-   No more release for more than 1 year
-   No update to branches: all changes in the trunk
-   standard/ almost stable: most things are in fact imported from other
    places

Current trunk status

-   Partly based on Quattor 13.1: most components not yet updated
    (validation required)
-   Support SL5 and SL6

3 different subsets shipped together

-   "Standard" templates
-   Provide a core node type without any grid dependency
-   Should be really standard: can it be the case for a Web server?
-   Grid templates
-   Templates generated from other Quattor components like AII or config
    modules

StratusLab templates delivered separately (git repo)

-   Support both ncm-spma v2 and v3

Work in progress

-   Remove templates related other Quattor components from standard/
-   Create a new namespace quattor/ with one sub-namespace per Quattor
    version: easier to move from one version to another one
-   YUM-based ncm-spma
-   Move to GitHub: do we keep the history?

To be done but not yet handled by lack of time

-   Namespace structure of OS templates
-   Integration of Aquilon
-   NFS configuration independent of grid templates

GitHub migration based on several repositories, no history kept

-   templ-library-standard: standard/ without the stuff imported from
    other places and without monitoring
-   monitoring not migrated
-   templ-library-core: templates imported from other Quattor components
    (config modules, AII, schema, Pan types...). Generated by the
    release process ideally, else some SCDB scripts may help (e.g.
    updateComponents)
-   master branch + 13.1 branch (ncm-spma v2)
-   Add standard/pan and standard/quattor other than AII
-   templ-library-grid: grid templates
-   1 branch per major grid MW version
-   templ-library-stratuslab: current strastuslab repository
-   templ-library-examples: current clusters/ and sites in SVN
-   Minor issue: how to keep a "unified view" of these separate
    repositories for pushing back from a unique place like in the past
-   git submodule are not appropriate for this
-   git subtree: requires additional options when pushing but may be
    explored
-   Luis will try to find some examples

### Core Quattor Schema

standard/pan and standard/quattor general templates were not migrated
from SF SVN: need to be added to template-library-core

Some suff added/changed for Aquilon: need to merge asap

-   Mostly additions but a few mods (network part in particular)

## Actions

Documentation

-   Getting Started section on quattor.org
-   Allow indexing of Trac wiki by robots
-   Move to quattor.org parts of general interest on QWG wiki

-   Implement ncm-ncd hooks
-   Add support for component aliasing
