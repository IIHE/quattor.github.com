The 18th Quattor workshop will take place in Madrid (UAM), from Tuesday Sept. 30 to Thursday Oct. 2 and registration is open. Look at workshop [web site](https://indico.cern.ch/event/328445) for logistics information and for the registration form.
The agenda will probably be drafted the last week of September but expect it to be full!
With a good amount of time for hands-on sessions, as it was very successful in last workshops.

As usual this workshop is mainly a F2F meeting of people who contribute to Quattor developments (can be all of you!) but this is also an
opportunity for "Quattor users" to meet with "experts", to discuss their local problems and to learn about Quattor future evolution
(and influence it!).

To summarize: everybody is welcome to participate!
