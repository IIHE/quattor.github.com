# Quattor Workshop - Budapest - 20/3/2012

[Agenda](https://indico.cern.ch/conferenceTimeTable.py?confId=176310#20120320)

## Community News

No new sites that we are aware of in the last six months.

CERN looking at Puppet for their new infrastructure and possibly as a
Quattor replacement on the future

-   Report at a future Quattor Workshop

DESY still using Quattor, may try to reestablish contact

SLAC looking at Quattor and requiring some help.

-   CNAF has contact

## PAN Compiler

v8 frozen: 8.4.7 is the last version released

-   No more support
-   If still using, upgrade to v9!

v9 first versions

-   Last released version is 9.1
-   RC1, RC2, RC3 released
-   9.1 is RC3 + Windows-related fixes
-   v8 deprecated features removed
-   "panc nutshell book"
-   "root" element for build info
-   May be an interesting feature to implement "profile cloning"
-   various bug fixes

v9.2 recently released

-   plan for removal of escaping: deprecate XMLDB, change tests to use
    pan xml
-   Enabled by a switch, the only option in v10
-   Profile may contain a flag saying if escaping has been used or not
-   Impact on SCDB
-   Componenent need update to be prepared to handle unescaped
    keys (values)
-   Expanded maven support
-   Currently archetype, simple build
-   Future: Maven has a Pan interface, in addition to ant
-   Support for JSON output format
-   Will enable transparent gziping almost for free in term of
    performance during compilation or even a positive one when IO is the
    limiting factor (eg. laptops)
-   Need to document how to enable gzip in downstream components
-   Skeleton for updated panc command in clojure
-   More consistency in the options, simplified/cleaner code for
    processing options in the compiler

v9 series roeadmap

-   Streamlined, simplified code with limited changes to functionality
-   Gradual migration to clojure: CLI, template compilation, functions,
    output formats...
-   Can be done incrementally
-   Limited inclusion of other libraries (e.g. Clojure, JSON)
-   Until now panc has been self contained
-   All included components have an Apache 2 (compatible) license

New requests from discussion

-   Range starting with a negative number (Luis): may lead to some
    grammar ambiguity not trivial to fix
-   panc as a service (Gabor): idea is to have a continuously running
    service to avoid the starting time cost when compiling only one
    profile
-   Functions to convert IP addresses (v4 and v6) to long integer (and
    vice versa) to help with netmasking and other similar things (Gabor)
-   Readd debugging information during dependency calculation to help
    identify the reason a dependency is not considered up to
    date (Michel)
-   Disappeared during v9 code refactoring
-   Add an info() function in addition to the warning() one to avoid
    abuse of warning() (Gabor)
-   function or pragma to activate debugging in a given template as an
    alternative to command line switches (Gabor)
-   Easier to use for people who are not Pan experts
-   May be great to say debug this template and all
    included templates...
-   Not easy to implement as compilation occurs before execution and
    debug code is removed in the debug flag is not set for the template:
    possible performance impact if checked during execution
-   In `include`, support a list of template rather than just
    one (Ronald)
-   Rename nlist to hash
-   Keep both as a function and deprecate nlist at some point
-   Add a section to the manual explaining the Pan vocabulary and how it
    matches the vocabulary in other languages

Discussion but no agreement on how to allow structure templates with
rights to modify other part of the configuration than the one they are
assign to or to pass parameters to normal templates...

-   Several goals: make things cleaner than using global variables
    (variable scope), make easier to non expert to use pan, entitlement
    (restrict a user to use one specific template to achieve a specific
    configuration action)...

### Annotation Support

2 possible approaches for building the output files produced by
annotation processing

-   Hierarchy based on input templates hierarchy: related to layout of
    input files
-   Makes input options more complex as some specific options are
    required just for annotation
-   Namespace : conflict between similar namespace in different template
    sets
-   Requires a wrapper to handle possible conflicts.

Decision : move annotation processing outside of panc compiler to a
separate tool

-   Will reuse the compilation module of panc
-   Makes having distinct options easier: keep the current behaviour
-   Will put less constraint on further extensions of the tool

## CCM

Problems

-   Scalability because of the backend storage format: mainly MS and
    Gent
-   Difficult to support new backend format like JSON
-   Supports only http URL: makes testing difficult
-   Remove of unescape() function

MS contributions in the last years

-   CDB\_File format x3 faster
-   Require an additional perl module: perl-CDB-File
-   Kerberos support for encryption

Recent work

-   JSON support: quite advanced, able to run components from the JSON
    file
-   Still need to test/Validate the results
-   Support of new protocols for downloading profiles: <file://>,
    <ftp://>, <ssh://>
-   But the underlying modules may not support all of them

Status

-   Rewritten modules have a large number of unit tests
-   Introduces new dependencies

JSON support issues

-   Some data types are lost: impossible to distinguish long and double
-   And Perl doesn't distinguish them internally from string...: means
    that you cannot know if the information was a string or a number
-   Pb doesn't exist with language distinguishing thems
-   No way to ask JSON about the type of a data
-   In fact getTree() already loose this information

unescape() removal

-   Will check the flag saying that the profile has been generated
    without escaping
-   IF the flag is set, will do nothing: just return the argument
    unmodified
-   No modification required to components, except if they use their
    private version of unescape()

Requests:

-   Have distinct exit code in ccm-fetch for failures related to network
    errors (Gabor)
-   May allow to switch between different profile sources

## AII

Known limitations

-   SL6 issues
-   LVM and reinstallation
-   Large installation disk support
-   Scalability: lack of large installation

MS additions/improvemnents

-   Profile caching: Profiles are cached for future reuse for better
    performances, using CDB\_FIle format for improved performances
-   Fine-grained locking: per-profile instead of globally
-   Allow to run aii-shellfe in // for several nodes
-   Allow monitoring of stalled installation by looking at lock
    timestamp
-   Partition alignment based on some provided information
-   Not really working with SL4
-   Parallel installation support: only partially merged as it requires
    PRocess::Parallel which is MS-specific
-   Some alternative may be found
-   New options: `-firmware` and `-livecd` to boot alternate images in a
    way similar to rescue
-   Target of these options defined in node profile

\*Full RHEL6/SL6 support

-   Schema made more flexible to add/remove mandatory or deprecated
    options
-   GPT used for partition tables, using `parted`
-   Anaconda doesn't die with large disks, much faster
-   Anaconda doesn't allow to reinstall changing some partitions and
    protecting others...
-   Built with Maven tools

New issues

-   Code quality is becoming a problem: many contributors, few tests,
    spaghetti code
-   May require a significant rewrite with unit tests
-   Kickstart file more and more difficult to read....
-   Debugging of Kickstart %pre and %post scripts can be
    very difficult...
-   May redirect everything to a file in /tmp and ensure all commands
    are logged

Pending issues/requests

-   Implement deferred reboot during installation based on a profile
    property: needed by MS
-   DHCP plugin by MS: would be great to have it release to the
    community
-   Replacement for aii-dhcp able to do more things looking at the whole
    profile information (like adding info required by Windows machine)
-   MS saw problems with machines where boot disk is renamed after some
    events (change) on the machine or OS upgrade
-   Would like to think at a mechanism to give an abstract name to disks
    and do late binding but difficult to implement into Kickstart

MS Stanley still considering reviving the Solaris port, including
installation port.

## Network Configuration

### ncm-network

Among the problems

-   Network restart during reconfiguration: potentially a problem on
    diskless systems
-   Code very difficult to maintain

Rewrite requirements

-   Separate each part of the configuration: interface, routing...
-   Reconfiguration without network restart
-   Support all current features
-   Add all the features that RH scripts support
-   Easy path from old to new component if possible
-   Use `ip` command rather than `ifconfig`and `route`

Routing configuration: rely on `ip route` rather than
ADRESS/NETMASK/GATEWAY

-   Convert route definition to a nlist: key is the subnet usual
    notation xx.xx.xx.xx/nn (nn being the number of bits in the netmaks)
-   Policy routing contributed by Gabor
-   Multipath routing: done by `ip route nexthop`

Status

-   Main missing part is the routing... Loic expects to have some time
    to work on it in the coming months...

IPv6 support required: no real reason to manage it in a separate
component, need to add it

Network schema

-   May require some refactoring: some information are improperly placed
    under `/system/network` and we need to support more information
    interface specific
-   An idea is to move this kind of information into the hardware
    description part and have the network configuration module looking
    there for this part of the information, based on the interface name

Other issues

-   loopback interface is not configured by network configuration module
    and is ignored. This doesn't allow to define aliases on it (Gabor)

### IPv6 readiness - R. Starink / P. Bernabé {#ipv6-readiness---r.-starink-p.-bernabe}

Evaluation work done at NIKHEF recently: goal was to identify what was
needed to be changed

-   Focus on mixed IPv4/v6 setup
-   Backward compatibility

Test cluster

-   Isolated from the world
-   OS: CentOS 5.5 64-bit
-   A dedicated Quattor server
-   Clients: basic OS to start, grid services later

Quattor server

-   PXE only supported for IPv4: mixed setup will be required to handle
    installation
-   As long as IPv4 is there, no change required on the server!

ncm-network

-   Schema: basic support for IPv6 but no support for mixed setup
-   Duplicate IP, gateway...
-   Some IPv6 enabling fields
-   How to specify IPv6 addresses: configure separately prefix and local
    part? What to bind prefixes to (interfaces? node?)?
-   Autoconfigure support?

QWG changes

-   Allow enabling IPv6 globally or per interface
-   A new table for IPv6 addresses with a more flexible layout allowing
    to handle multiple addresses per node
-   IPv6 parameters: per network?

ncm-iptables

-   A few mods already made to enhance patterns for IPv6 and add
    protocol options

Other components: difficult to predict needed changes

-   Service specific probably?

Conclusion (next steps)

-   Focus on schema for IPv6 description: ensure enough flexibility to
    cover different use cases without too much unnecessary complexity
-   Ask Paco if he can contributes
-   Ask IPv6 experts (in particular in HEP community) to assess the
    proposed schema

## Aquilon and other MS Tools

Current status

-   AII, CCM mods released thanks to Luis
-   ncm-network changes contributed
-   ncm-sysctl not yet modified: waiting for escape/unescape removal
-   quattor-remote-configure available but quattor-remote-deployer not
    yet released as it is being rewritten

5 core developpers, many support engineers

-   Current focus is to allow more operations without editing templates
    as Aquilon usage extended to less standard machines (non "grid")
-   Plan is to add more commands into Aquilon that will deal with more
    advanced operations

Quattor Remote Deployer (QRD) status: equivalent of ncm-ncd to manage
non Linux devices

-   Python rewrite of the old Perl code
-   QRD relies on Quattor Remote Configure (QRC) to execute components:
    QRC already released
-   ython rewrite requires a Python CCM API

Aquilon changes and main developments

-   More changes made by Aquilon commands and less template
    editing, e.g. assign specific features to an existing personnality
-   Make easier for users to make trivial changes
-   Reduce the risk of a big mistake by exposure of templates and the
    right to modify them
-   HW features: generic description of HW features implemented using
    vendor tools and their specific options
-   1 template to enable/disable a feature including a vendor/model
    specific template definining the required configuration
-   Under namespace `features/hardware`
-   Added description of clusters (VMware clusters, high availability
    clusters): members (e.g. assignment of VMs to an ESX clusters),
    reboot constraints, file system descrption allowing attaching remote
    file systems...
-   Will add possibility to assign a VM to a single host (e.g.
    running KVM) rather than an ESX cluster
-   Planning to add support for defining service address (moving with
    VMs or shared by several) in Aquilon
-   Request to model Windows cluster in Aquilon
-   But real use may require a GUI...
-   Working on modelling network switches and configuring them QRD

Aquilon appliance

-   Still on SourceForge but not updated... lacking templates to be
    useful
-   Looking for "pop-up" installations via cloud
-   Appliance uses Debian

Mac OSX support: proof of concept of other OS support in Aquilon

-   ncm-directoryservices to configure OpenDirectory: ncm-mcx
-   ncm-ncd, ccm-fetch all works
-   CCM uses DB\_File
-   A bit of fixing needed in quattor-build-tools
-   A single package created (alpha version) and put on SourceForge:
    "Managed Quattor Client for OS X"

### Fostering Aquilon adoption

James's experience

-   No major problem in using QWG templates, a few minor modifications
    needed
-   James agreeing to write a short report about these...
-   Main difficulty is the different workflow between SCDB and Aquilon
-   Aquilon upgrade: DB upgrade scripts only provided for Oracle
-   Aquilon supports whatever DB backend is supported by SQLAlchemy
-   Need to maintain backend specific upgrade scripts: PostgreSQL seems
    the most important to support

Appliance work required to allow early adopters to look at it

-   Update Aquilon version
-   Add QWG templates
-   Add ability to check out templates from appliance

RAL will have a summer student to work on Aquilon in July for 3 monthts

-   Try to get the new appliance ready by then.

### Quattor Remote Deployer experience at MS

Goal: manage non Linux devices that offer some sort of API for remote
management

-   E.g. ESX clusters, switches, file appliances...
-   Handle iniitial configuration and reconfiguration

2 parts in the system

-   QRD itself: equivalent of ncm-cdispd
-   Receives profiles and decide what to do
-   Uses a plugin for either installation (aii, configuration of the
    boot server) or for configuration (QRC)
-   Quattor Remote Configure (QRC) : equivalent of ncm-ncd
-   1 framework and specialized components

Choice of distributed (redundant) QRD/QRC configuration

-   Main goal is redundancy: multiple source of the configuration easy
    to implement with http
-   Every QRD receives the notification and they use a lock to ensure
    only one is really execute the configuration actions
-   Shared data (NFS) between all instances for locks and
    cached profiles... not ideal
-   Modified CAF::Lock to implement NFS locks
-   If possible, achieve better scalability but not really easy because
    of potential locking issues that may negatively impact the
    performances

In QRC, implemented conditional execution of dependencies based on the
fact they have a change in their configuration...

-   Check whether it makes sense to feed back into ncm-ncd

QRD

-   Different modes and connectors implemented by plugins that have
    their own (simple) configuration
-   Analyze of the work to be done : multiple configuration changed
    notifications merged in one action
-   Does everything needed to move to the last config successfully
    deployed to the new one
-   Keep track of the plugin status to decide if a config was
    succesfully applied

QRD improvements needed

-   Too much locking that may lead to a configuration deployment being
    postponed indefinitely
-   Locking + grouping is overcomplicated and 2 levels of locking are
    probably unnecessary
-   IO performance problem with NFS
-   Lack of visibility of action progress: difficult to troubleshoot why
    a request is not executed
-   Impossible to execute an action without a CDB notification (profile
    change): no dry run, no possibility to force the redeployment of a
    configuration without a profile change...
-   Requires direct use of QRC
-   endless retry loop: useless...
-   After a failure, a component will be re-run regularly, without any
    config change (default: 5 mn): difference with ncm-cdispd

Current status

-   In production at MAS for 1 1/2 year
-   Known problems are well identified
-   Rewrite in progress but not yet ready

## QWG Templates

Input based on RAL work.

### YAIM Support

Goal: allow to reuse RPM lists for grid services as they exist in QWG
but use ncm-yaim rather than standard QWG configuration to do the actual
service configuration

-   BDII as a proof of concept

Proposal

-   Define a variable `USE_QWG_CONFIG` to select the configuration
    variant
-   Create for each service 2 namespace `qwg` and `yaim`
-   Rename current `service.tpl` into `qwg\config.tpl`
-   Create a new `service.tpl` that will include RPMs and acts as a
    switch between both variants

Open questions

-   Account configuration: with YAIM or with `ncm-account`?
-   Try to support both and compare

### RPM list management

Would be desirable to manage separately the RPM list and the RPM version
to use

-   RPM lists can be generated from an OS distribution
-   Would make easier the maintenance of templates in config/os: should
    not require a change with new versions as long as the RPMs are
    the same.

Need to improve the XSL stylesheet processing the distribution comps.xml
to produce the information in this new format.

-   Template defining default version will be included at the beginning
    of every RPM template for a non disruptive migration

## SL6 issues

ncm-network changes to manage udev made by MS but not yet contributed
back.

grub/spma inconsistency with new kernel names including architecture:
fixed by last `spma` (-12).

ldapauth configuration completely changed

-   New configution supported through a new configuration subtree in the
    component

SPMA and SELinux: SPMA requires a new SELinux effort to work

-   Added by last version in SF repository

## Monitoring

### Experience with Nagios and Icinga at UGent

Main goal: dynamic reconfiguration of monitoring

-   Currently done by a Python framework parsing the XML profiles to
    produce the required monitoring configuration
-   At UGent, everything is described in Quattor
-   The framework produces a template that is used by the Icinga server:
    currently no automatic reconfiguration of the monitoring server
-   Current QWG approach relies on a static definition of groups in a
    specific template and is difficult to keep in sync with the actual
    config: at least the risk of discrepancies
-   Plan to handle this with Aquilon in the future
-   Unclear if it will really impact the overall workflow

Host groups a host belong to are defined in the Quattor configuration

-   Processed by the Python framework to generate the appropriate
    monitoring configuration

ncm-icinga: written from scratch

-   Schema different from ncm-nagios
-   Configuration information required (variables) is basically the same

Status

-   Doing last tests
-   Production targeted end of April
-   Want to look at Aquilon this summer

QWG Todo: document the variables related to monitoring and common to
both Nagios and Icinga

-   Already some information on the Trac wiki

## Configuration Modules

Configuration module status report

-   State file managed/generated by ncm-ncd and ncm-cdispd in last
    versions
-   Requires a 'state' drective defining the state directory in the
    ncm-ncd and the ncm-cdispd configuration file
-   Presence of the file denotes a component that should run and
    indicate the error if there was one in a previous run
-   TODO: add an option to ncm-ncd to display the configuration modules
    that are waiting to run and whether they experienced an error in a
    previous run

Test mode: 'noaction' property should do the job if the configuration
module uses CAF

-   Will display file to be opened, command to be executed rather than
    doing it

Would be great to keep not only the latest profile but the last one.

-   ccm-purge could keep a given number of profiles or all the profiles
    more recent that a certain time interval
-   ncm-query could be enhanced to list differences between profiles
    with several levels of details: components impacts, detailed config
    change for part of the configuration tree...

Delayed execution: see
\[/wiki/Meetings/Workshops/20111011\#ChangeScheduling Strasbourg's
minutes\]

-   No work since

Support for other languages: desirable but not urgent

## YUM Support

3 good reasons to use YUM (at least!)

-   Scale down Quattor entry level: may be easier for small sites to add
    their packages
-   Remove a Quattor specific component to maintain
-   Enable support of other platforms

Concentrate first on making possible to use YUM as a packager rather
than SPMA in a flexible way.

Proposal

-   Make the packager an implicit dependency of all components rather
    than an explicit one
-   ncm-cdispd will be no longer concerned by ensuring it is run first
-   ncm-ncd will be in charge of running the packager before any action:
    may require to pass a new option from cdispd or to add an option in
    the ncd configuration file

Corner case: ability to force a component like filecopy to run before
the packager to fix a problem preventing its successful execution

-   See later if there is a real use case: may add a property to
    components like `runFirst` to force their run before the packager

packager specific configuration modules (ncm-yum, ncp-apt..) should take
the package information from the same part of the configuration tree
(`/software/packages`)

-   Configuration description should remain independent of the packager

## Community Life and Development Process/Tools

### Quattor Build and Test Process and Tools

StratusLab experience

-   Build with maven as the driver
-   Easy to wrap non-java builds and to use other build tools like make
-   Tools should have unit tests
-   Nexus as a package repository
-   Works well with maven: packages pushed automatically after build
-   Wth maven, has very clean dependency resolution process:
    dependencies automatically pulled in with transitive dependency
    resolution
-   A new snapshot entry created by maven every time it runs and
    produces something new
-   Package repository at the heart of the build process
-   Continous integration with Hudson/Jenkins
-   Continuous build of the SW, triggered by modifications to the
    package repository
-   Can also do build on demand
-   Installation of test infrastructures
-   Allows to manage dependencies between test stages but not working
    well as a workflow manager (ability to take different decisions
    based on result of a stage)
-   SlipStream for system testing
-   Workflow-like features to manage deployment of virtual machines
-   Growing use for system deployments and testings
-   Web server for release distributions
-   YUM based repositories for published releases

Proposal for Quattor

-   Move `quattor.org` DNS domain to an active institue to allow more
    flexible updates
-   Need ability to create entries in this domain
-   Discuss with CERN immediate transfer of primary server and possible
    transfer of ownership: LAL primary, RAL secondary
-   Start wth same toolset as for StratusLab
-   Decide where to put the tools: StratusLab cloud? persistent disk for
    data?
-   Move Nexus server from LAPP to the same place as other tools?
-   Demonstrate builds for core tools
-   Some already maven-ready
-   PRobably \~10 more to convert to new build tools:
    cdispd/listend/ncd, aquilon, rpmt-py/spma, ncm-templates, ncm-query
-   Not necessary to convert them to Maven
-   Deployment/test of Quattor "HelloWorld"
-   Simple test configuration based on Aquilon appliance?
-   Perform "release" of core tools
-   Devise same procedure for configuration modules
-   Think about unit test environment: Luis started some work
    around this...

Actions

-   DNS changes: Michel
-   Jenkins, Nexus deployment: Cal
-   Integration of core tools: Cal + tool maintainers
-   Target date for initial setup: \~1 month

Extend the number of people with Maven knowledge...

-   Not a requirement for the very short term... core tool maintainers
    are a very limited set of people
-   Trac page reasonnably up to date...

Quattor releases: let's review how we do it when we have the build
infrastructure in place

-   With YUM, no need of metarpm
-   The main issue is not bringing dependencies but identify what are
    the stable versions of all components that work together
-   "HelloWorld" test configuration may help to assess what is ready for
    releasing

Weekly standup meetings

-   Should run without Michel: Luis and Ronald agrees to backup

Main priorities should focus usability rather than new features

-   Cookbooks to start with Quattor and its core tools
-   Reuse the panc idea
-   Foster Aquilon adoption as a tool hiding the template complexity
-   Possibility for a Quattor dashboard
-   Possibility to reuse/adapt existing tools like Foreman?
-   Quattor as a tool to manage virtualized infrastructure
-   Start by documenting existing use cases and experiences in blog
    entries, e.g. LAL work within StratusLab to manage images rather
    than machines

### Quattor Public Visibility and Community

Main page move to GitHub

-   Need to change DNS... see previous actions
-   Cal makes a proposal that can be reviewed
-   Populate with a few entries all the categories of information
-   Put Oloh! widget on the web page
-   Go live!

News broadcasting

-   Send more general/regular news should appear on the main web site
-   Broadcast it to the general mailing list
-   Tweet this news: any plugin to do it automatically?

Reserve Quattor name on Google+, LinkedIn, (Fabebook?)

-   Cal will do it

IRC: try to continue to listen it despite the low activity...

Dissemination materials

-   Build an internal repository for existing dissemination materials
    that could be reused by others to make presentations

Miscellaneous

-   Fix link to Quattor home page in WallStreet Tech article about MS
    usage of Linux/Quattor (Nick)
-   Or add a redirect in Mediawiki page

## Conclusions

Next workshop: U. of Gent

-   Doodle asap to fix the dates after UGent fed back their constraints
